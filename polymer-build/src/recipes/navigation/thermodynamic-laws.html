        When energy passes, as work, as heat, or with matter, into or out from a system, the system's internal energy
        changes in accord with the law of conservation of energy. Equivalently, perpetual motion machines of the first
        kind (machines that produce work without the input of energy) are impossible.

        In a natural thermodynamic process, the sum of the entropies of the interacting thermodynamic systems increases.
        Equivalently, perpetual motion machines of the second kind (machines that spontaneously convert thermal energy
        into mechanical work) are impossible.

        The entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero.
        With the exception of non-crystalline solids (glasses) the entropy of a system at absolute zero
        is typically close to zero, and is equal to the natural logarithm of the product of the quantum ground states.
