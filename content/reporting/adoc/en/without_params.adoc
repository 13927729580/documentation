== Report without parameters

Sometimes you don't need Wizard's functionality to create a report.
You can always create a report manually.
Let us cover one more case or creating a report that will have no parameters and will display
all books from database in one table.
We will take again the sample https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-library[*Library*] application as a basis.

Click *Create* -> *New* in the *Reports* screen to proceed.

Thus we fall directly into *Report editor*.
To illustrate the possible straightforward structure of report, we create 3 bands with *Root*
as parent: *Title, TableHeader* and *Books*. Two first we leave empty, for Books we add a dataset with a query to display all books from database as well as all the details on them:
[source, sql]
----
select b.name as "book_name", a.first_name||' '||a.last_name as "author",
lp.name as "publisher", cast(bp.year_ as varchar(4)) as "year",
ld.name as "department", count(bi.id) as "amount"
from library_book b
    join library_book_author_link ba on ba.book_id = b.id
    join library_author a on a.id = ba.author_id
    join library_book_publication bp on bp.book_id = b.id
    join library_publisher lp on lp.id = bp.publisher_id
    join library_book_instance bi on bi.book_publication_id = bp.id
    join library_library_department ld on ld.id = bi.library_department_id
where b.id is not null
group by bp.year_, lp.name, a.first_name||' '||a.last_name, b.name, ld.name
order by a.first_name||' '||a.last_name asc;
----

Then create manually the report template with 3 obligatory bands declared in *Report structure*, add the template file as default template, and save the changes.

Now the newly created report is available in Reports browser, and if you click *Run*, the report file is downloaded without querying for parameters.

To enhance your report, you can add some decorations or charts by means of software you create your template in. The charts should be constructed using named regions that correspond the bands of the report.
