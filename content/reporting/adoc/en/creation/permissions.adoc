=== Report Access Rights

You can define user rights to access the report as well as report availability in certain application screens in the *Roles and Screens* tab of the report editor.

If the report roles list contains at least one role, the report will be available only to users with this role. If no roles are specified, the report is available to everyone.

The screens list allows to specify, which screens the report will be available in when invoking `RunReportAction`, `TablePrintFormAction` or `EditorPrintFormAction` <<run_actions, actions>>. If no screen is specified, the report won't be available from any screen.
