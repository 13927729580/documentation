== Sample Report

In this chapter we will consider the structure of one of reports from the sample *Library* application, which source code is available at https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-library.

To use reports in your project, activate the *reports* item in the *App components* list on the *Project properties* page
of CUBA Studio.

Open the *Reports* -> *Reports* screen and click on the *Import* button to import the report. Choose Reports.zip in the project root directory. Two reports will appear in the table, one of them will be Books by author. This report displays the list of book publications for selected author; books will be grouped by book name and publisher. The output format is XLS.

Let us consider report bands.

* *header* band - report header. It contains the dataset with the Groovy script which outputs the report <<parameters, external parameters>> values:

[source, groovy]
----
[['authorName' : (params['author'].firstName + ' ' + params['author'].lastName)]]
----

* The *book* band outputs the list of books by running the following SQL query:

[source, sql]
----
select b.name as book_name, b.id as book_id
from library_book b 
    join library_book_author_link ba on ba.book_id = b.id
    join library_author a on a.id = ba.author_id
where a.id = ${author}
----

This query uses the external report parameter - *author*. The parameter has the *Entity* type, however in SQL queries you can compare it directly with entity identifier fields; the conversion will be done automatically.

* The *publisher* band, which is a child band of *book*, outputs the book publishers by running the following SQL query:

[source, sql]
----
select p.name as publisher, bp.year, p.id as publisher_id
from library_book_publication bp
    join library_publisher p on p.id = bp.publisher_id
where bp.book_id = ${book.book_id}
----

This query uses the parent band field `++book_id++` as a parameter. This provides dependency between the parent and child bands.

* The *publication* band, which is a child of the *publisher* band, outputs the book publications by running the following SQL query:

[source, sql]
----
select ld.name as department, count(bi.id) as amount
from library_book_instance bi
    join library_book_publication bp on bp.id = bi.book_publication_id
    join library_library_department ld on ld.id = bi.library_department_id
where bp.publisher_id = ${publisher.publisher_id} and bp.book_id = ${book.book_id}
group by ld.name
----

This query uses both parent bands fields as parameters - `++book_id++` and `++publisher_id++`.
--

. Report <<parameters, parameters>>.
+
The *Parameters and Formats* tab contains one declared report external parameter - *Author*:
+

+
When running the report, the user will have to enter this parameter. The author selection will be performed via the `library$Author.lookup` screen, available in the application.

. Report <<template, templates>>.
+
The *Templates* tab contains a single defined XLS template, loaded from `BooksByAuthor.xls`
+

. Report Name <<localization, Localization>>.
+
The *Localization* tab contains the report name for the Russian locale:
+
[source, properties]
----
ru = Книги по автору
----

You can <<running, run>> report from the generic browser in the *Reports* -> *Run Reports* screen.

[[without_params]]
== Report without parameters

Sometimes you don't need Wizard's functionality to create a report.
You can always create a report manually.
Let us cover one more case or creating a report that will have no parameters and will display
all books from database in one table.
We will take again the sample https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-library[*Library*] application as a basis.

Click *Create* -> *New* in the *Reports* screen to proceed.

Thus we fall directly into *Report editor*.
To illustrate the possible straightforward structure of report, we create 3 bands with *Root*
as parent: *Title, TableHeader* and *Books*. Two first we leave empty, for Books we add a dataset with a query to display all books from database as well as all the details on them:
[source, sql]
----
select b.name as "book_name", a.first_name||' '||a.last_name as "author",
lp.name as "publisher", cast(bp.year_ as varchar(4)) as "year",
ld.name as "department", count(bi.id) as "amount"
from library_book b
    join library_book_author_link ba on ba.book_id = b.id
    join library_author a on a.id = ba.author_id
    join library_book_publication bp on bp.book_id = b.id
    join library_publisher lp on lp.id = bp.publisher_id
    join library_book_instance bi on bi.book_publication_id = bp.id
    join library_library_department ld on ld.id = bi.library_department_id
where b.id is not null
group by bp.year_, lp.name, a.first_name||' '||a.last_name, b.name, ld.name
order by a.first_name||' '||a.last_name asc;
----

Then create manually the report template with 3 obligatory bands declared in *Report structure*, add the template file as default template, and save the changes.

Now the newly created report is available in Reports browser, and if you click *Run*, the report file is downloaded without querying for parameters.

To enhance your report, you can add some decorations or charts by means of software you create your template in. The charts should be constructed using named regions that correspond the bands of the report.
