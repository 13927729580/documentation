=== Running from the Generic Reports Browser

The easiest way to run reports is from the generic browser, which is available in the *Reports* -> *Run Reports* screen. The user must have the right to access this screen. The list will contain all reports that are <<permissions, available to the user>> in accordance with their role. If the report has external parameters, they will be requested in a special form when running the report.
