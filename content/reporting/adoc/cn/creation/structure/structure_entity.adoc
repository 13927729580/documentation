==== Entity Dataset

*Entity* dataset consists of a single row and is produced using attributes of a single entity instance and the entities related to it.

The data source is produced from an external parameter of the *Entity* type, which must be described in the *Parameters and Formats* tab. The value in the *Entity parameter name* field must match the parameter name.

The report template must contain fields with entity attribute names. Attributes used in the template should be listed in the special window, which is invoked by the *Select entity attributes* button.
