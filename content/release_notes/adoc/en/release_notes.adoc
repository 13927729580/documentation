[[overview]]
== Overview

This document highlights major changes in CUBA Platform and Studio version {revnumber}.

[[platform]]
== Platform

=== All Resolved Issues

[[platform_breaking_changes]]
=== Breaking Changes

. one.

. two

[[data_model]]
=== Data Model

[[id_sequences]]
==== Generation of Integer Identifiers

In the previous versions, the `Metadata.create()` method assigned `Long` and `Integer` identifiers only to entities from the main data store. Now identifiers are assigned to all persistent entities inherited from `BaseLongIdEntity` and `BaseIntegerIdEntity`. The new identifiers are fetched from automatically created database sequences. By default, the sequences are created in the main data store. However, if the {manual_app_props}cuba.useEntityDataStoreForIdSequence[cuba.useEntityDataStoreForIdSequence] application property is set to true, sequences are created in the data store the entity belongs to.

[[gui]]
=== Generic UI

[[icon_sets]]
==== Icon Sets

Icon sets allow you to decouple usage of icons in visual components from real paths to images in theme or font element constants. They also simplify overriding of icons used in the UI inherited from application components. See details in the {manual}/icon_set.html[documentation].

[[default_screen]]
==== Default Screen

We have added a number of application properties to manage a default screen opening after login. It can be the same screen for all users, or users can choose for themselves. Also, there is an option for disabling close button on such screen. See details in the {youtrack}/PL-6844[issue].

[[polymer_client]]
=== Polymer UI

[[rest_api]]
=== REST API

[[reporting]]
=== Reporting

[[misc]]
=== Miscellaneous

[[app_lifecycle_events]]
==== Application Lifecycle Events

The application events mechanism can now be used for registering listeners notified after full initialization and before termination of the application. It can be used instead of adding listeners by the `AppContext.addListener()` static method. See the {manual}/app_lifecycle_events.html[documentation] for details.

[[upd_dep]]
=== Updated Dependencies

[[theme_variables]]
=== Theme Variables Editor

This editor enables managing variables which are used to quickly customize a Generic UI {manual}/web_theme_extension.html#web_theme_extension_common[theme]. It is available via the *Manage theme > Edit Halo theme variables* link on the *Project properties* tab. The link becomes active if you have created a theme extension in your project.

[[app_properties]]
=== Application Properties Editor

This editor allows you to edit application properties manually. Later we are going to add code completion and validation to it.

[[build_scripts]]
=== Build Scripts

In the previous Studio version, when you changed the module prefix (which is `app` by default), Studio completely rewrote `build.gradle` and `settings.gradle`, which might cause the loss of a custom code in these files. In the new version, when you create a new project, its build scripts have the `modulePrefix` variable, which is used instead of string literals. Thus, when you need to change the module prefix, Studio simply replaces the value of this variable and doesn't rewrite the whole file. For an old project which doesn't have such variable, rewriting is still needed, but it happens only once, and after that the variable is added to the scripts.

[[gradle_version_by_project]]
=== Gradle Versions

As you know, Studio can work with projects based on different platform versions. These projects can also require different versions of Gradle, which are specified for the project's Gradle wrapper in `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`. Now Studio determines which version of Gradle is required when opening the project, and downloads it if it is not yet cached locally. When downloading and installing Gradle, Studio shows a modal window.

[[import_from_git]]
=== Import Project from Git

The *Import project* dialog allows you to import a project directly from a Git repository, if it doesn't require authentication. Select *Git* option, enter a URL and select a local directory where to create the project. Studio will clone the repository and immediately open the project.

[[artifact_version]]
=== Project Artifact Version

The *Advanced* tab of the *Project properties* page now contains the *Artifact* section which allows you to set the project artifact version. If the *Snapshot* checkbox is selected, artifact names will have the SNAPSHOT suffix.

The version parameter is stored in the `build.gradle` file in the `cuba.artifact` section. This section also specifies the artifact group, but we don't provide an option to change it in UI because by convention the artifact group must be equal to the project root package.

[[comp_db_scripts]]
=== Database Scripts for Application Components

If your project uses an application component, there is a chance that the component does not contain database initialization scripts for your database. For example, if the component was developed on HSQLDB and you are using PostgreSQL. In such case Studio generates scripts for the component and shows them on the `Init component tables` and `Init component constraints` tabs of the `Database scripts` page:

image::studio_comp_db_scripts.png[align="center"]

[[safe_db_updates]]
=== Safe Database Updates

Now Studio generates more safe update scripts when you remove an entity, an attribute, or change an attribute's datatype. Such scripts are split to two parts: in the first part, the column or table is renamed to `*__UNUSED`, and in the second part these objects are actually dropped. In the example below, the `foo` attribute was removed from the `Customer` entity. The first script renames the column:

image::studio_no_removal_1.png[align="center"]

The second script drops it:

image::studio_no_removal_2.png[align="center"]

As you can see, the script containing DROP statement is highlighted in red to emphasize the fact that you can lose some data.

Additionally, we have added an ability to exclude scripts from automatic execution, but still have them in the project to be able to execute manually when needed. If you click the *Exclude selected* button, you will have an option to move the script to a special directory: `modules/core/db/update-manually`. The script will not be executed automatically, so the `FOO__UNUSED` column will remain in the table, but you will be able to execute the script manually and drop the column later.
