[[overview]]
== Overview

This document highlights major changes in CUBA Platform and Studio version {revnumber}.

[[platform]]
== Platform

=== All Resolved Issues

* https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issues/PL?q=Milestone:%20%7BRelease%206.6%7D%20State:%20Fixed,%20Verified%20Fix%20versions:%206.6.0%20Affected%20versions:%20-SNAPSHOT%20sort%20by:%20created%20asc[Platform 6.6.0 Resolved Issues]


[[platform_breaking_changes]]
=== Breaking Changes

. All Java code is now compiled with UTF-8 encoding (https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/PL-9042[PL-9042]). If you have source code files in different encodings, you may get unreadable messages in your application.

. Kryo serialization is used by default (https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/PL-8906[PL-8906]). If you experience any problems, you can switch to standard Java serialization using the {manual_app_props}cuba.serialization.impl[cuba.serialization.impl] application property.

. Due to the reworked mechanism of exporting properties by application components (https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/PL-9048[PL-9048]), there is no need to include `cuba-app.properties` and `cuba-web-app.properties` in the application's lists of property files anymore. When migration is done by Studio, it automatically removes these entries from your `web.xml` files. Otherwise, remove them manually.

. Previously, if an external authentication (LDAP or SSO) was on, a user could bypass it if he or she had a valid password set in the application security subsystem. Now it is possible only if the user's login is also listed in the {manual_app_props}cuba.web.standardAuthenticationUsers[cuba.web.standardAuthenticationUsers] application property (https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/PL-9314[PL-9314]).

. Settings of a visual component are saved only if the componentâ€™s id is set (https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/PL-9167[PL-9167]).

. `ExcludeAction` now unlinks entities with many-to-many relation (https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/PL-7515[PL-7515]).

. `CollectionDatasource.sort()` always triggers the sorting even if the `sortInfos` array is the same as before (https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/PL-9273[PL-9273]).

. `Grid.focusCell()` method now has default access level. New public `Grid.focusBodyCell()` method has been added (https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/PL-9305[PL-9305]).

[[deployment]]
=== Deployment

[[uber_jar]]
==== Single Uber JAR

The {manual}/build.gradle_buildUberJar.html[buildUberJar] Gradle task can now be configured to build a single all-in-one JAR file including all application blocks.

All you have to do is to set to `true` the `singleJar` parameter (it is `false` by default to preserve existing configurations), for example:

[source, groovy]
----
task buildUberJar(type: CubaUberJarBuilding) {
    singleJar = true
    coreJettyEnvPath = 'modules/core/web/META-INF/jetty-env.xml'
    appProperties = ['cuba.automaticDatabaseUpdate' : true]
}
----

After building, you can run your application with a single command:

----
java -jar app.jar
----

See the documentation on how to provide different options when {manual}/build.gradle_buildUberJar.html[building] and {manual}/uberjar_deployment.html[running] your application.

[[polymer_in_single_war]]
==== Polymer UI in Single WAR

If your project contains Polymer UI and you use single WAR deployment, the UI will be available at `<app-name>/front` URL, for example:

----
http://localhost:8080/app/front
----

[[gui]]
=== Generic UI

[[image_component]]
==== Image Component

The new {manual}/gui_Image.html[Image] component greatly simplifies displaying of images from different sources:

* from an entity attribute of `FileDescriptor` or byte array types
* from a classpath resource
* from a file
* from an input stream
* from a theme resource
* from a URL

The component can also be bound to a datasource and configured declaratively.

==== Standard Actions API

The standard collection {manual}/list_actions.html[actions]: `CreateAction`, `EditAction`, `AddAction` and `RefreshAction` now have `set{XYZ}ParamsSupplier()` methods that allow you to compute provided parameter values right before the action is executed. For example:

[source,java]
----
action.setWindowParamsSupplier(() -> ParamsMap.of("customer", getItem()));
----

Previously it could be achieved only by extending the action class and overriding its `get{XYZ}Params()` methods.

[[misc]]
=== Miscellaneous

==== JMX Asynchronous Execution

The `@JmxRunAsync` annotation allows you to denote long JMX operations. When such operation is launched using the built-in JMX console, the application displays a special dialog and a user can close it and continue to work with the application by pressing *Cancel*  or if the operation has timed out. See details in the {manual}/jmx_beans_creation.html[documentation].

==== User Session Log

It's a new platform feature that allows administrators to track user sessions, particularly the login, logout and user substitution events. The log is available on the *Administration > User Session Log* screen.

[[reporting]]
=== Reporting

If the `reporting.useBackgroundReportProcessing` application property is set to true and reports are executed in a background thread, they can be aborted if the user clicks *Cancel* button or by a timeout. When a report is cancelled or timed out, the execution is aborted both on the middleware and in the database. See {reporting}/run_cancel.html[documentation] for details.

[[studio]]
== Studio

=== All Resolved Issues

* https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issues/STUDIO?q=Milestone:%20%7BRelease%206.6%7D%20State:%20Fixed,%20Verified%20Fix%20versions:%206.6.0%20Affected%20versions:%20-SNAPSHOT%20sort%20by:%20created%20asc[Studio 6.6.0 Resolved Issues]

[[studio_breaking_changes]]
=== Breaking Changes

. Hot deploy mapping settings has been moved to project settings located in `studio-settings.xml` (https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/STUDIO-3605[STUDIO-3605]). It means that they are now shared between all developers working on the project, provided that `studio-settings.xml` is under a version control system. The hot deploy on/off flag has been kept in the user settings.

. Due to changes in https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/STUDIO-3680[STUDIO-3680] for HSQL database, Studio may generate database update scripts to map `Date` attributes to `date` SQL type and `Time` attributes to `time` SQL type. These scripts will erase data in the changed columns, so you may want to avoid them. Just change the entity attributes to `DateTime` type and Studio will not generate any updates.

=== Repository Configuration

The artifact repository is now configured on per-project level. The *Repository* field has been moved from the Studio server window to the *Project properties* page:

image::repository_1.png[align="center"]

You can select from two default repositories or add your own after setting it up as described in the {manual}/private_repo.html[documentation]. This repository will be scanned by Studio to discover available platform versions. Your `build.gradle` file can also contain any number of other repositories containing application components if needed.

=== REST API Services and Queries

Studio now contains UI for configuring REST API queries and service methods.

In order to create a named REST query, select an entity and click *New > REST query*. After that, define the query as on the example below:

image::rest_query_1.png[align="center"]

Service methods can be exposed through the REST API on the *REST Methods* tab of the service designer:

image::rest_service_1.png[align="center"]

=== Pages History

The *Ctrl+Shift+H* shortcut opens a dialog that contains the list of pages recently opened in Studio. It allows you to go to these pages again without looking them up in the left panel or in Search dialog:

image::pages_history_1.png[align="center"]

=== Browser and Editor Template

Now you can create standard browser and editor screens by selecting a single template:

image::browser_and_editor_1.png[align="center"]

=== Frame Template

We have added a simple template for creating blank frames:

image::frame_1.png[align="center"]

=== Mapping Database Views

Now database views can be mapped to entities when generating model from an existing database. The only restriction is that the view must contain a column or a set of columns suitable for the entity identifier.

Views are shown together with tables in the same list. If you select a view for mapping, on the next screen its status will be *Choose primary key for DB view*. Click the *Choose PK* button at the bottom and select columns for the primary key:

image::view_1.png[align="center"]

=== Column DDL

The *Column definition* field in the entity designer allows you to specify a custom definition for the column type, for example:

image::column_definition_1.png[align="center"]

If the field is not empty, Studio will insert its value as is into the column's DDL right after the column name.

=== Test Infrastructure

If you create a new project based on the platform 6.6+, Studio will generate the {manual}/integration_tests_mw.html[integration test] infrastructure in its *core* module. See created classes in the `modules/core/test` folder. You can run the tests from the IDE or from the command line (provided that you have created the Gradle wrapper):

[source, plain]
----
gradlew test
----
