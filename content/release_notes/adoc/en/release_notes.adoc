== Platform

[[platform_breaking_changes]]
=== Breaking Changes

. The structure of storing references to entities in Entity Log, Entity Snapshots and Dynamic Attributes has been changed. If you have accessed internals of these mechanisms from your application code, you may need to change it accordingly. {youtrack}/issue/PL-8461[PL-8461].

. Now we use default behavior of Vaadin's Valo theme ({youtrack}/issue/PL-8267[PL-8267]) :

* `HBox` and `VBox` use `overflow: auto` CSS mode. If a `HBox` or `VBox` has a child with 0 height then the layout will have non-zero height.
* Font size is inherited using normal CSS rules instead of explicit setting for components.

. The `fileExists()` method of `FileStorageAPI` now declares `FileStorageException`. If you invoke this method, add a `catch` block. {youtrack}/issue/PL-8866[PL-8866].

. Validation for input parameters of `UniqueNumbersAPI` methods has been added. A sequence name can contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores, otherwise `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown. {youtrack}/issue/PL-8724[PL-8724].

. Due to cluster improvements explained <<cluster,below>>, pay attention to the following:

* If you don't use Studio migration procedure, edit `spring.xml` files of all client modules used in your project, find the `xyz_proxyCreator` bean definitions and replace:
+
--
[source, xml]
----
<property name="clusterInvocationSupport" ref="cuba_clusterInvocationSupport"/>
----

with

[source, xml]
----
<property name="serverSelector" ref="cuba_ServerSelector"/>
----
--

* `jgroups.xml` has been split into two files: `jgroups.xml` (UDP stack) and `jgroups_tcp.xml` (TCP stack). Use `cuba.cluster.jgroupsConfig` application property to select the stack.

. Due to improvements in `FieldGroup` component explained <<field_group,below>>:

* Class `FieldGroup.FieldConfig` has been refactored to interface. Now you cannot create `FieldConfig` instance using constructor as it became a Java interface. Use `FieldGroup.createField(id)` instead.

* `FieldConfig.setDatasource()` now does not trigger creation of `Field` components. Use an additional `FieldGroup.bind()` call.


. Option dialogs opened with `showOptionDialog()` method of screen controllers are always closed after selecting an option, even if an exception occurs in `actionPerform()`. {youtrack}/issue/PL-8610[PL-8610].

. Microsoft's JDBC driver is now used instead of jTDS if the project uses Microsoft SQLServer database. Studio performs automatic migration when upgrading the project to platform 6.5. {youtrack}/issue/PL-8826[PL-8826].

. *Reporting*. If no screens are specified for a report, it is not shown on pop-up window of screen reporting actions. {youtrack}/issue/PL-8618[PL-8618].

. *Charts and Maps*. Chart API has been reworked, see <<chart_api,below>>. {youtrack}/issue/PL-7754[PL-7754].

. *Charts and Maps*. The `GoogleMapViewer` interface has been deprecated, use the `MapViewer` component directly. {youtrack}/issue/PL-8787[PL-8787].

[[uber_jar]]
=== Uber JAR

CUBA applications can now be deployed as executable JAR files containing the application code, all dependencies and embedded HTTP server. See
{manual}/uberjar_deployment.html[UberJAR Deployment] for details.

[[cluster]]
=== Cluster Improvements

[[cluster_load_balancing]]
Middleware Load Balancing::
+
--
Previously, the web client blocks did not perform balancing when worked with multiple middleware blocks. They chose a middleware server from the list specified in the `cuba.connectionUrlList` at startup and didn't change it until it became unavailable. So the load balancing was possible only between multiple web blocks (and if `cuba.randomServerPriority` was set to true): first web block works with first middleware, second web with another middleware and so on. If `cuba.randomServerPriority` was set to false, each client block selected a middleware block that was first in its `cuba.connectionUrlList`.

Now the balancing is much more granular - on the user session level. A middleware server is randomly determined on the first remote connection for a user session, and it is fixed for the whole session life time ("sticky session"). Requests from anonymous session and without session do not stick to a server and go to random servers.

The algorithm of selecting a middleware server is provided by the `cuba_ServerSorter` bean which is by default implemented by the `RandomServerSorter` class. You can provide your own implementation in the project or use `NoopServerSorter` to revert to the old behavior when client always selects the first available server from its `cuba.connectionUrlList`.
--

[[cluster_zookeeper]]
Coordination Using ZooKeeper::
+
--
Application blocks interact in a cluster in two ways: middleware blocks interact with each other, web blocks send requests to middleware. These channels of communication are based on different mechanisms (JGroups for inter-middleware interaction, Spring HTTPInvoker for requesting middleware from clients), however they both require discovering of current cluster topology - what middleware servers are up now and how to connect to them. By default, the following approaches are used:

* For communication between middleware blocks you set up UDP or TCP stack with some discovery methods. In case of UDP stack the discovery can be automatic as it is based on broadcasting UDP messages. However, broadcasting is often disabled in production environments, so the only reliable method of discovery is to specify the list of server addresses for TCPPING protocol in `jgroups.xml`. It means that the topology is static - you have to know it in advance when starting a middleware server.

* For requesting middleware from client blocks, you have to specify addresses of the middleware blocks in the `cuba.connectionUrlList` application property. It also makes the configuration static - you have to know addresses of the middleware servers when starting a client block.

Now we provide an application component that enables dynamic discovery of middleware servers for both communication channels. It is based on integration with https://zookeeper.apache.org[Apache ZooKeeper] - a centralized service for maintaining configuration information. When this component is included in your project, you need to specify only one static address when running your application blocks - the address of ZooKeeper. Middleware servers will advertise themselves by publishing their addresses on the ZooKeeper directory and discovery mechanisms will request ZooKeeper for addresses of available servers. If a middleware server goes down, it will be automatically removed from the directory immediately or after a timeout.

The source code of application component is available on https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba-zk[GitHub], the binary artifacts are published in the standard CUBA repositories. See https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba-zk[README] for information about including and configuring the component.

[[rest_api]]
=== REST API Improvements

[[rest_api_model_versioning]]
Model Versioning::
+
--
REST API v2 now contains a mechanism that allows you to change your data model but keep compatibility with existing REST clients. If a request from a client contains the `modelVersion` parameter, REST will apply a set of JSON transformations defined in a special XML configuration file. There are predefined transformations like removing or replacing an attribute, and you can provide custom classes for arbitrary transformations of schema and values. See {manual}/rest_api_v2_data_model_versioning.html[documentation] for details.
--

[[rest_api_persistent_token_store]]
Persistent Token Store::
+
--
By default, REST API v2 OAuth tokens are stored in memory only, which means clients need to re-login if the middleware server is restarted. Now you can turn on persistent storage for authentication tokens: see {manual}/rest_api_v2_persistent_token_store.html[documentation] for details. You may also want to increase token expiration timeout using the `cuba.rest.client.tokenExpirationTimeSec` application property, which is 12 hours by default.
--

[[file_Loader]]
=== FileLoader Interface

The new `FileLoader` interface allows you to work with files contained in {manual}/file_storage.html[File Storage] uniformly from the client and middle tier using input/output streams. It's a managed bean that can be injected or obtained via `AppBeans` class and it provides `openStream()` and `saveStream()` methods to load and save files. Both client and middleware implementations of the interface do not keep the whole file in memory, so you can pass files of any size without the risk of reaching memory limits.

[[field_group]]
=== FieldGroup API

We have reworked API of the `FieldGroup` component, deprecated old procedural methods and added support for dynamic change of the set of fields.

Breaking changes::
+
--
Class `FieldGroup.FieldConfig` has been refactored to interface. Now you cannot create `FieldConfig` instance using constructor as it became a Java interface. Use `FieldGroup.createField(id)` instead.

`FieldConfig.setDatasource()` now does not trigger creation of `Field` components. Use an additional `FieldGroup.bind()` call.
--

Deprecated::
+
--
All methods `setField<Something>(fieldId, value)` and `set<Something>(fieldId, value)` have been deprecated. Use `FieldConfig` APIs instead:

[source, java]
----
fieldGroup.getFieldNN("login").setVisible(false);
----

Method `FieldGroup.addCustomField` has been deprecated. Now, it is recommended to obtain `FieldConfig` and call `setComponent(Component)`:

[source, java]
----
LookupField languageLookup = factory.createComponent(LookupField.class);
...
fieldGroupRight.getFieldNN("language").setComponent(languageLookup);
----
--

New features::
+
--
You can specify separate `property` XML attribute for data binding:

[source, xml]
----
<fieldGroup id="fieldGroup" datasource="userDs" width="AUTO">
    <field id="position1x" property="position"/>
</fieldGroup>
----

We have introduced the `FieldGroupFieldFactory` bean that can be replaced globally or for a certain `FieldGroup` instance using `fieldFactoryBean` XML attribute or `FieldGroup.setFieldFactory()` method.

Now you can add/remove fields on the fly using methods: `addField(FieldConfig)`, `addField(FieldConfig, colIndex)`, `addField(FieldConfig, colIndex, rowIndex)`, `removeField(fieldId)`.
--

See {youtrack}/issue/PL-8776[PL-8776] for more details.

[[data_grid]]
=== DataGrid Component

We have introduced inline editor for `DataGrid` component. `DataGrid` supports line-based editing, where double-clicking (or using Enter key) a row opens the row editor. In the editor, the input fields can be edited, as well as navigated with Tab and Shift+Tab keys. If validation fails, an error is displayed and the user can correct the inputs. It allows a user to edit rows inside of `DataGrid` using a special editable representation of a row.

See {manual}/gui_DataGrid.html#gui_DataGrid_inline_editor[Usage of DataGrid Inline Editor].

[[managed_tabsheet]]
=== Managed TabSheet

New `cuba.web.mainTabSheetMode` application property defines which component will be used for Tabbed mode of main window:

. Default `TabSheet` component.
. Managed `TabSheet` component that doesn't unload tab content from the browser when a user selects another tab.

This property can have one of the two string values: `DEFAULT` or `MANAGED`.

`MANAGED` option is useful when you integrate some thirdparty web UI to your application as HTML `iframe` using the `Embedded` component. In case of `DEFAULT` mode content of a tab and embedded `iframe` will be completely reloaded on each selected tab switch. If you use `MANAGED` option then content of a tab remains in a browser memory and will not be reloaded when user switches tabs.

See {youtrack}/issue//PL-8464[PL-8464] for more details.

[[charts]]
=== Charts

Charts API has been simplified:

* Introduced separate component interfaces for all charts: AngularGaugeChart, FunnelChart, GanttChart, PieChart, RadarChart, SerialChart, XYChart. They contain methods that are relevant for a concrete chart implementation.
* Improved data binding. Now you can simply call `addData()` method to add items to a chart.

*Note:* charts XML markup fully compatible with the previous version.

New API usage example:
[source, java]
----
public class OrderBrowse extends AbstractLookup {
    @Inject
    private PieChart pieChart;  // we can inject typed Chart interface

    @Override
    public void init(Map<String, Object> params) {
        super.init(params);

        // no need to obtain configuration object and cast it to PieChart
        pieChart.setDepth3D(15)
                .setAngle(15)
                .setBalloon(
                        new Balloon()
                                .setColor(Color.AQUA)
                );

        // just add data, no need to create and set ListDataProvider
        pieChart.addData(MapDataItem.of("name", "Some String",
                                        "value", 75));
        pieChart.addData(MapDataItem.of("name", "Another String",
                                        "value", 12));
    }
}
----

Removed::
+
--
* `Chart.setConfiguration()` - now you have to use concrete Chart interface inheritor.
* `Chart.isByDate()` and `Chart.setByDate()` - now you have to use SeriesBasedChart interface and assign value to `CategoryAxis.parseDates` property.
--

Moved::
+
--
* `Chart.add<SomeEvent>Listener` methods now are available only for concrete Chart interfaces.
* Methods `zoomOut`, `zoomToIndexes`, `zoomToDates` have been moved to SeriesBasedChart interface.
* Methods `zoomOutValueAxes`, `zoomOutValueAxis`, `zoomOutValueAxis`, `zoomValueAxisToValues`, `zoomValueAxisToValues` have been moved to CoordinateChart interface.
--

Deprecated::
+
--
* Constant `Chart.NAME` no more corresponds to concrete Component class.
* `Chart.getConfiguration()` - now you can use concrete Chart inheritor instead, but you still can configure chart using old code based on configuration object.
--

If you declare charts in XML then concrete chart components will be created and you can inject them to your controller:
[source, java]
----
@Inject
private SerialChart columnChart;
@Inject
private GanttChart ganttChart;
----

To migrate old code that uses event listeners you have to add type casts (or use the new chart interface):
[source, java]
----
@Inject
private Chart pieChart;
...
((PieChart) pieChart).addSliceClickListener(event -> {
});
----

Simplified data binding API::
+
--
* Added convenient constructors to MapDataItem
* New `addData` method is available from any Chart interface
[source, java]
----
pieChart.addData(MapDataItem.of("name", "Some String",
                                "value", 75));
pieChart.addData(MapDataItem.of("name:", "Another String",
                                "value", 12));
----
--

See {youtrack}/issue/PL-7754[PL-7754] for more details.

[[polymer]]
=== Polymer UI
Polymer templates have been adopted to use CUBA Studio's snippets mechanism. All templates use the same snippets for entity `-list` and `-edit` components generation. Also properties and methods of `-list` and `-edit` components were extracted to the corresponding behaviors: `CubaEntityEditViewBehavior` and `CubaEntityListViewBehavior` which are available in `cuba-ui` package.

[[polymer_routing]]
Routing::
'Entity CRUD actions' templates were merged to a single 'Entity management' template however you still can choose between cards/simple list representation. The component generated by this template contains routing logic for switching between list and editor state. The state is bound to the URL using `app-route` components so it is possible to navigate directly to a particular entity editor.

[[polymer_lookup]]
Lookup Approach::
`cuba-lookup` component provides an ability to specify entity `-list` component in order to select an entity instance for a reference attribute. The list component should be marked with `.lookup-screen` class.
+
--
[source, html]
----
<link rel="demo-manufacturers-by-country.html">

<cuba-lookup picked-entity="{{entity.manufacturer}}">
  <div class="dropdown">
    ... <!-- dropdown-->
  </div>
  <demo-manufacturers-by-country class="lookup-screen"></demo-manufacturers-by-country>
</cuba-lookup>
----
--

[[polymer_file_upload]]
File Upload Field::
https://github.com/cuba-elements/cuba-file-field[`cuba-file-field`] element provides an ability to upload file to the server. Uploaded file will be shown as clickable link.
+
--
[source, html]
----
<cuba-file-field file-descriptor="{{entity.photo}}"></cuba-file-field>
----

[[studio]]
== Studio

[[studio_breaking_changes]]
=== Breaking Changes

[[polymer_templates]]
==== Polymer Templates

Templates which are used for Polymer UI scaffolding were changed to support routing improvements.
In order to adopt those changes and use new templates you have to perform manual upgrade on your
Polymer client source code. The changes are listed below.

. Add `cuba-ui` dependency to the `bower.json`:
+
--
[source, json]
----
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "cuba-ui": "cuba-elements/cuba-ui#^0.1.0",
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----
--
. Add `cuba-ui` import to the `{namespace}-shell.html`:
+
--
[source, xml]
----
<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/cuba-ui/cuba-ui.html">
----
--
. Make the following changes in `{namespace}-shell.html`:
.. add `tail` property binding in the `app-route` component:
+
--
[source, xml]
----
<app-route route="{{route}}" pattern="/:page" data="{{routeData}}" tail="{{routeTail}}">
----
--
.. set `selected-attribute="active"` in the `iron-lazy-pages` component:
+
--
[source, xml]
----
<iron-lazy-pages selected="[[_computeSelectedPage(routeData.page)]]" attr-for-selected="data-route" selected-attribute="active" class="content fit">
----
--
.. add the following listener and handler:
+
--
[source, javascript]
----
Polymer({
  is: 'namespace-shell',
  ...
  listeners: {
    'navigate': '_onNavigate'
  },
  ...
  _onNavigate: function(event, detail) {
    this.set("route.path", detail);
  }
});
----
--

[[screen_templates]]
==== Screen Templates

The API of screen templates has been reworked, so if you have created your own templates, they most probably won't work in Studio 6.5.

The following API methods have been removed: `getEditorNestedDatasourceProperties()`, `getEditorNestedCollectionDatasourceProperties()`, `generateDescriptorFileName()`, `generateFiledGroupXml()`, `getEditorCollectionAttributesTablesXml()`, `getBrowseColumns()`, `generateControllerNameByDescriptorName()`.

The removed methods are replaced with two new methods: `processSnippet()` and `evaluateScript()`, and a number of "snippets" and "scripts". These reusable parts of templates are located in the `snippet` subdirectory of the templates folder. As a result, all the logic previously hidden inside Studio API is now available in the form of micro-templates.

See Studio context help on the templates editing page for details.

[[bintray]]
=== Bintray Repository

All binary artifacts of CUBA platform and Premium Add-ons are now published also on https://bintray.com[Bintray]. Currently we are considering the usage of Bintray as experimental, but if you have any trouble accessing our `repo.cuba-platform.com` repository, you can easily switch to Bintray by selecting it in the Studio Server window:

----
https://dl.bintray.com/cuba-platform/main
----

Authentication for this repository is not needed. After reopening your project, Studio will automatically update the `buildscript.repositories` section of your `build.gradle`. There will be separate declarations of all needed repositories, such as `mavenCentral`, `jcenter`, etc.

If you use Premium Add-ons, `build.gradle` will contain additional repository:

----
maven {
    url 'https://cuba-platform.bintray.com/premium'
    credentials {
        username(rootProject.hasProperty('premiumRepoUser') ?
                    rootProject['premiumRepoUser'] : System.getenv('CUBA_PREMIUM_USER'))
        password(rootProject.hasProperty('premiumRepoPass') ?
                    rootProject['premiumRepoPass'] : System.getenv('CUBA_PREMIUM_PASSWORD'))
    }
}
----

Studio provides credentials automatically from your subscription information.

When you build your project with Bintray from the command line, there is a distinction from `repo.cuba-platform.com` repository in how to specify credentials. For Bintray, you should add `@cuba-platform` suffix to the user name, for example:

----
gradlew assemble -PpremiumRepoUser=123456123456@cuba-platform -PpremiumRepoPass=abcdefabcdef
----

=== Support for Bean Validation

Studio now contains UI for setting field-level bean validation annotations. It is available on the entity attribute panel, for example:

image::bean_validation_2.png[width=800]

Please note that you should enter annotation values exactly as they appear in Java code. This is especially important in regular expressions where you should escape \ symbols, for example:

image::bean_validation_1.png[width=800]

=== Groovy-based Entity Listeners

If you have selected *Groovy support* on the *Project properties > Advanced* tab,

image::groovy_entity_listener_1.png[width=800]

you can select *Groovy* when creating an entity listener:

image::groovy_entity_listener_2.png[width=800]

=== Scaffolding Custom Datasources

image::custom_datasource_1.gif[width=800]

=== Localized Messages in UI Designer

Studio screen layout designer now displays localized messages (in default locale) instead of message keys. In the example below, the button has its `caption` attribute set to `msg://myButton`, but the layout display *My Button* caption that is set in a message pack for this key:

image::loc_messages_1.png[width=800]
