[[overview]]
== Overview

This document highlights major changes in CUBA Platform and Studio version {revnumber}.

[[platform]]
== Platform

=== All Resolved Issues

* https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issues/PL?q=Milestone:%20%7BRelease%206.5%7D%20State:%20Fixed,%20Verified%20Fix%20versions:%206.6.0%20Affected%20versions:%20-SNAPSHOT%20sort%20by:%20created%20asc[Platform 6.6.0 Resolved Issues]


[[platform_breaking_changes]]
=== Breaking Changes

. All Java code is now compiled with UTF-8 encoding (https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/PL-9042[PL-9042]). If you have source code files in different encodings, you may get unreadable messages in your application.

. Kryo serialization is used by default (https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/PL-8906[PL-8906]). If you experience any problems, you can switch to standard Java serialization using the {manual_app_props}cuba.serialization.impl[cuba.serialization.impl] application property.

. Due to the reworked mechanism of exporting properties by application components (https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/PL-9048[PL-9048]), there is no need to include `cuba-app.properties` and `cuba-web-app.properties` in the application's lists of property files anymore. When migration is done by Studio, it automatically removes these entries from your `web.xml` files. Otherwise, remove them manually.

. Previously, if an external authentication (LDAP or SSO) was on, a user could bypass it if he or she had a valid password set in the application security subsystem. Now it is possible only if the user's login is also listed in the {manual_app_props}cuba.web.standardAuthenticationUsersWhiteList[cuba.web.standardAuthenticationUsersWhiteList] application property (https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/PL-9314[PL-9314]).

. Settings of a visual component are saved only if the componentâ€™s id is set (https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/PL-9167[PL-9167]).

. `ExcludeAction` now unlinks entities with many-to-many relation (https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/PL-7515[PL-7515]).

. `CollectionDatasource.sort()` always triggers the sorting even if the `sortInfos` array is the same as before (https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/PL-9273[PL-9273]).

. `Grid.focusCell()` method now has default access level. New public `Grid.focusBodyCell()` method has been added (https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/PL-9305[PL-9305]).


[[uber_jar]]
=== Single Uber JAR

[[image_component]]
=== Image Component

[[studio]]
== Studio

=== All Resolved Issues

* https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issues/STUDIO?q=Milestone:%20%7BRelease%206.5%7D%20State:%20Fixed,%20Verified%20Fix%20versions:%206.6.0%20Affected%20versions:%20-SNAPSHOT%20sort%20by:%20created%20asc[Studio 6.6.0 Resolved Issues]

[[studio_breaking_changes]]
=== Breaking Changes

. Hot deploy mapping settings has been moved to project settings located in `studio-settings.xml` (https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/STUDIO-3605[STUDIO-3605]). It means that they are now shared between all developers working on the project, provided that `studio-settings.xml` is under a version control system. The hot deploy on/off flag has been kept in the user settings.

=== Repository Configuration

The artifact repository is now configured on per-project level. The *Repository* field has been moved from the Studio server window to the *Project properties* page:

You can select from two default repositories or add your own after setting it up as described in the {manual}/private_repo.html[documentation]. This repository will be scanned by Studio to discover available platform versions. Your `build.gradle` file can also contain any number of other repositories containing application components if needed.

=== REST API Services and Queries

Studio now contains UI for configuring REST API queries and service methods.

In order to create a named REST query, select an entity and click *New > REST query*. After that, define the query as on the example below:

image::rest_query_1.png[align="center"]

Service methods can be exposed through the REST API on the *REST Methods* tab of the service designer:

image::rest_service_1.png[align="center"]

=== Pages History

The *Ctrl+Shift+H* shortcut opens a dialog that contains the list of pages recently opened in Studio. It allows you to go to these pages again without looking them up in the left panel or in Search dialog:

image::pages_history_1.png[align="center"]

=== Browser and Editor Template

Now you can create standard browser and editor screens by selecting a single template:

image::browser_and_editor_1.png[align="center"]

=== Frame Template

We have added a simple template for creating blank frames:

image::frame_1.png[align="center"]

=== Mapping Database Views

Now database views can be mapped to entities when generating model from an existing database. The only restriction is that the view must contain a column or a set of columns suitable for the entity identifier.

Views are shown together with tables in the same list. If you select a view for mapping, on the next screen its status will be *Choose primary key for DB view*. Click the *Choose PK* button at the bottom and select columns for the primary key:

image::view_1.png[align="center"]

=== Column DDL

The *Column definition* field in the entity designer allows you to specify a custom definition for the column type, for example:

image::column_definition_1.png[align="center"]

If the field is not empty, Studio will insert its value as is into the column's DDL right after the column name.
