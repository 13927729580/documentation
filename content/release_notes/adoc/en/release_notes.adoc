[[theme_variables]]
=== Theme Variables Editor

This editor enables managing variables which are used to quickly customize a Generic UI {manual}/web_theme_extension.html#web_theme_extension_common[theme]. It is available via the *Manage theme > Edit Halo theme variables* link on the *Project properties* tab. The link becomes active if you have created a theme extension in your project.

[[app_properties]]
=== Application Properties Editor

This editor allows you to edit application properties manually. Later we are going to add code completion and validation to it.

[[build_scripts]]
=== Build Scripts

In the previous Studio version, when you changed the module prefix (which is `app` by default), Studio completely rewrote `build.gradle` and `settings.gradle`, which might cause the loss of a custom code in these files. In the new version, when you create a new project, its build scripts have the `modulePrefix` variable, which is used instead of string literals. Thus, when you need to change the module prefix, Studio simply replaces the value of this variable and doesn't rewrite the whole file. For an old project which doesn't have such variable, rewriting is still needed, but it happens only once, and after that the variable is added to the scripts.

[[gradle_version_by_project]]
=== Gradle Versions

As you know, Studio can work with projects based on different platform versions. These projects can also require different versions of Gradle, which are specified for the project's Gradle wrapper in `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`. Now Studio determines which version of Gradle is required when opening the project, and downloads it if it is not yet cached locally. When downloading and installing Gradle, Studio shows a modal window.

[[import_from_git]]
=== Import Project from Git

The *Import project* dialog allows you to import a project directly from a Git repository, if it doesn't require authentication. Select *Git* option, enter a URL and select a local directory where to create the project. Studio will clone the repository and immediately open the project.
