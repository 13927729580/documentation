== Displaying Charts

CUBA platform charts display subsystem supports various chart types: pie charts, line plots, bubble charts, radar charts, funnel charts and more. It is also possible to export charts. Most chart types support zoom and scrolling. At the moment of writing, the chart display subsystem supports only the *Web Client* for *Vaadin7*.

*AmCharts* library which is the basis of the chart display subsystem is distributed under a license, which allows its free use if you keep the link to the library website. Alternatively, you can link:$$http://www.amcharts.com/online-store$$[purchase^] an *AmCharts* license for your project and remove the link.

[[chart_configuration]]
=== Configuring Charts

Charts are displayed using the `Chart` component acting as a universal canvas. Chart type is defined by the `configuration` property, which has the `AbstractChart` type.

.Chart Types Hierarchy
image::chart/charts-hierarchy-dia.svg[align="center"]

Charts can be described in a screen XML-descriptor. To do this, you should connect the corresponding `namespace`:

[source, xml]
----
<window xmlns="http://schemas.haulmont.com/cuba/window.xsd"
        xmlns:chart="http://schemas.haulmont.com/charts/charts.xsd"
        ...>
----

XML elements corresponding to different chart types:

* `chart:xyChart` - XYChart
* `chart:serialChart` - SerialChart
* `chart:pieChart` - PieChart
* `chart:funnelChart` - FunnelChart
* `chart:gaugeChart` - AngularGaugeChart
* `chart:radarChart` - RadarChart
* `chart:ganttChart` - GanttChart

Each chart type has its own set of attributes and methods, which replicate the functionality of the corresponding charts from AmCharts library. Documentation on the properties and methods of the charts is available at link:$$http://docs.amcharts.com/3/javascriptcharts$$[docs.amcharts.com/3/javascriptcharts].

Any configuration attribute can be set to `null`; in this case the system will use the default value (except the cases specified in the *AmCharts* documentation).

[[serial_chart]]
==== SerialChart

The `SerialChart` component allows you to create line, area, column, bar, step line, smoothed line, candlestick and OHLC charts. The charts support multiple axes with simple or logarithmic scales, the data points can be displayed at equal/irregular intervals or on timeline basis.

[[pie_chart]]
==== PieChart

The `PieChart` component allows you to create pie/donut charts.

.PieChart
image::chart/pie-chart.svg[align="center"]

[[xy_chart]]
==== XYChart

The `XYChart` component allows you to create XY/bubble/scatter charts. The charts support multiple axes with simple or logarithmic scales.

.XYChart

[[funnel_chart]]
==== FunnelChart

The `FunnelChart` component allows you to create funnel/pyramid charts.

.FunnelChart
image::chart/funnel-chart.svg[align="center"]

[[radar_chart]]
==== RadarChart

The `RadarChart` component allows you to create radar/polar charts.

.RadarChart
image::chart/radar-chart.svg[align="center"]

[[gauge_chart]]
==== AngularGaugeChart

The `AngularGaugeChart` component allows you to create gauge charts.

.GaugeChart
image::chart/gauge-chart.svg[align="center"]

[[gantt_chart]]
==== GanttChart

The `GanttChart` component allows you to create Gantt charts. Gantt charts usually display multiple bars on one series where value axis displays date/time and is horizontal.

.GanttChart
image::chart/gantt-chart.svg[align="center"]

[[chart_data_binding]]
=== Connecting Data

There are two ways how you can pass data to a chart: through the `DataProvider` interface or using the datasource mechanism. 

* The `DataProvider` interface has a standard implementation: `ListDataProvider` class. It contains a list of `DataItem` instances, each one containing a set of key-value pairs. An instance of `DataProvider` is passed to the `setDataProvider()` method of chart configuration. This approach to providing chart data is the most universal, but it requires you to create instances of `DataProvider` and `DataItem` in a screen controller.

* A `CollectionDatasource` type datasource can be assigned to a `Chart` component by invoking the `setDatasource()` method. This approach requires an entity that will represent chart data. It may be convenient when such entity already exists in the application data model and also when chart data should be displayed as a table.

<<chart_example>> illustrates both approaches to providing chart data.

Entity properties or the values contained in an instance of `DataProvider` which are used for display purposes are defined in the chart attributes. The set of chart attributes may differ for different chart types. For example, for the `chart:pieChart` component, you should define the `valueField` and `titleField`attributes. The following types are allowed for attribute values: `Integer`, `Long`, `Double`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Date`.

Dynamic addition of data to an existing chart is supported only using the datasource mechanism.

[[chart_listeners]]
=== Events

It is possible to configure handling of different event types. The following listener types are available:

* `AxisZoomListener` - chart axis scaling.
* `ChartClickListener` - click on the canvas.
* `RightClickListener` - right click on the canvas.
* `CursorPeriodSelectListener` - selection of the display period with a cursor.
* `CursorZoomListener` - scaling of the chart area with a cursor.
* `GraphClickListener` - click on a graph.
* `GraphItemClickListener` - click on a graph item.
* `LegendItemHideListener` - hiding a legend item.
* `LegendItemShowListener` - showing a legend item.
* `LegendItemClickListener` - click on a legend item.
* `SliceClickListener` - click on a slice in a pie chart.
* `SliceRightClickListener` - right-click on a slice in a pie chart.
* `SlicePullInListener` - shift of a slice of a pie chart into the chart.
* `SlicePullOutListener` - shift of a slice of a pie chart out of the chart.
* `ZoomListener` - scaling of the canvas.

Event handling examples are available in <<section_use_of_events>>.

[[chart_example]]
=== Example of Working with Charts

This chapter shows how you can use the chart display subsystem.

[[chart_project_setup]]
==== Setting up the Application Project

. Run CUBA Studio, create new project and name it *sampler*.

. Open *Project properties* -> *Edit* and include the *charts* project into the list of *Base projects*; save changes. Confirm when *Studio* will suggest recreating Gradle scripts.

. Select *Run* -> *Deploy*. At this point, the application will be assembled and deployed to the Tomcat application server located at `build/tomcat`.

. Select *Build* -> *Create or update IDEA project files* to create project files for *IntelliJ IDEA*.

Once the steps above are complete, the chart display functionality will be connected to the application and ready to be used.

[[chart_data_from_entity]]
==== Creating Chart with Data from an Entity

For the first example we will create the chart similar to link:$$https://www.amcharts.com/demos/3d-stacked-column-chart/$$[3D Stacked Column Chart^] from *AmCharts* demos. The `JavaScript` source code is as follows:

[source,javascript]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/chart/column3d-chart.js[]
----

[[cdb_create_model]]
===== Creating an Entity

. Open the *Entities* tab in CUBA Studio and click *New entity* button.

. In the *New entity* dialog type `CountryGrowth` in the *Class name* field, choose `Not persistent` for *Entity type* and click *OK* button.

. Using *Entity Designer* add attributes:
* `country` of the type `String`
* `year2014` of the type `Double`
* `year2015` of the type `Double`

. Open the *Source* tab to see generated source code:
+
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/chart/CountryGrowth.java[]
----
+
This class describes non-persistent entity. An instance of this class contains the number of the country GDP growth rate for 2014 and 2015 years.

. Click *OK* button to save the entity and close the designer screen.

. In the *Entities* tab click *Generate DB scripts* button and save scripts.

. Create the application database by selecting *Run* -> *Create database*.

[[cdb_creating_chart]]
===== Creating Chart

[[cdb_xml_descriptor]]
====== Screen XML Descriptor

Open the *Screens* tab in CUBA Studio and create a screen in the *web* module. Enter the value *`com/company/sampler/web/screens/column3d-chart.xml`* in the *Reference* field. The fields - *Id*, *Controller Name* and *Messages Pack* will be filled in with appropriate values. Save changes. Open the *XML* tab and replace its content with the following code:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/chart/column3d-chart.xml[]
----

The root element of the screen descriptor contains a new `xmlns:chart` attribute:

[source, xml]
----
<window xmlns:chart="http://schemas.haulmont.com/charts/charts.xsd"
    ...
>
----

The chart retrieves data from the `countryGrowthDs` datasource defined in the `datasource` attribute. Names and values are displayed using the `country`, `year2014` and `year2015` attributes of the `CountryGrowth` entity; the list of instances for this entity is stored in the datasource. The datasource is also connected to the table that shows the same data as the chart.

The `chart:serialChart` component contains the following attributes:

* `angle` - defines the chart angle. May have a value from `0` to `90`.

* `balloonText` - defines text for the tooltip that appears when hovering over a pie slice. You can use the following tags: `\[\[value\]\]`, `\[\[title\]\]`, `\[\[persents\]\]`, `\[\[description\]\]`, as well as keys from the `DataItem` listed in a `DataProvider` instance, or names of the entity attributes from the datasource. To use `html` tags you must escape them.

* `depth3D` - chart thickness. When used in combination with the `angle` attribute, helps to create a 3D effect.

* `plotAreaFillAlphas` - opacity of the plot area.

* `startDuration` - duration of the animation, in seconds.

* `categoryField` - a key from the set of pairs contained in the `DataItem` objects listed in a `DataProvider` instance; this key is used to determine the labels for the category axis.

The `chart:serialChart` component contains the following elements:

* `chart:categoryAxis` - an element that describes the category axis.
** The `gridPosition` attribute specifies if a grid line is placed on the center of a cell or on the beginning of a cell.

* `chart:valueAxes` - an element that defines vertical value axes. In our case, only one vertical axis is used; the axis is described by the `chart:axis` element.
** The `position` attribute defines position of the value axis relative to the chart.
** Setting `stackType` to `BOX_3D` makes the chart display columns one behind the other.

* `chart:graphs` - an element that contains the collection of `chart:graph` elements; the graph is described by the `chart:graph` element.
** The `type` attribute defines the type of the graph and can be: line, column, step line, smoothed line, olhc and candlestick.
** The `valueField` attribute defines a key from the list of pairs contained in the `DataItem` objects listed in a `DataProvider` instance; this key is used to determine the value of a pie chart slice.
** The `fillAlphas` attribute defines opacity of fill. The `lineAlpha` attribute defines opacity of the line (or column border). Value range is 0 - 1.

* `chart:export` – an optional element that enables chart export.

[[cdb_screen_controller]]
====== Screen Controller

Open the *Controller* tab and replace its content with the following code:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/chart/Column3dChart.java[]
----

The `init(Map<String, Object> params)` method populates the `countryGrowthDs` datasource with the data. The `refresh()` method initializes the datasource. This method should be invoked regardless of the `refreshMode="NEVER"` attribute declared in the XML-descriptor.

[[cdb_result]]
===== Result

. Open the *Main Menu* tab in CUBA Studio and click *edit* button for `web-menu.xml`.

. Choose *`application`* item and click *new* button.

. In *Create menu item* dialog choose `column3d-chart` for *id* field and click *add*.

. Select *Run* -> *Start application server*.

After logging in and opening the screen from the application menu you will see the chart like below:

.Column 3D Chart
image::chart/column3d-chart.svg[align="center"]

[[chart_with_data_provider]]
==== Creating Chart with Data from DataProvider

This chart retrieves data through the `DataProvider` created in the controller (see below), so the `datasource` attribute is not defined.

[[cdp_creating_chart]]
===== Creating Chart

[[cdp_xml_descriptor]]
====== Screen XML Descriptor

Open the *Screens* tab in CUBA Studio and create a screen in the *web* module. Enter the value *`com/company/sampler/web/screens/stackedarea-chart.xml`* in the *Reference* field. The fields - *Id*, *Controller Name* and *Messages Pack* will be filled in with appropriate values. Save changes. Open the *XML* tab and replace its content with the following code:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/chart/stackedarea-chart.xml[]
----

The root element of the screen descriptor contains a new `xmlns:chart` attribute:

[source, xml]
----
<window xmlns:chart="http://schemas.haulmont.com/charts/charts.xsd"
    ...
>
----

`chart:serialChart` attributes:

* `categoryField` - a key from the set of pairs contained in the `DataItem` objects listed in a `DataProvider` instance; this key is used to determine the labels for the category axis.

The elements of `chart:serialChart`:

* `chart:chartCursor` - an optional element adding a cursor to the chart; the cursor follows the mouse pointer and shows a tooltip with the value of the corresponding point on a chart.
** The `cursorAlpha` attribute defines opacity of the cursor line.

* `chart:legend` - an element that defines the chart legend.
** The `position` attribute defines the location of the legend relative to the chart.
** The `equalWidths` attribute specifies if each of legend entry should be equal to the most wide entry.
** The `periodValueText` attribute defines the text which will be displayed in the value portion of the legend when user is not hovering above any data point. The tags should be made out of two parts - the name of a field (value / open / close / high / low) and the value of the period you want to be show - open / close / high / low / sum / average / count.
** The `valueAlign` attribute defines alignment of the value text. Possible values are "left" and "right".
** The `valueWidth` attribute defines width of the value text.

* `chart:valueAxes` - an element that defines vertical value axes. In our case, only one vertical axis is used; the axis is described by the `chart:axis` element.
** The `position` attribute defines position of the value axis relative to the chart.
** The `title` attribute defines the title of the value axis. The position attribute defines position of the value axis relative to the chart.
** Setting `stackType` to `REGULAR` makes the chart display a rolling value. Setting this attribute to `none` refers to a non-rolling value.
** The `gridAlpha` defines opacity of grid lines.

* `chart:graphs` - an element that contains the collection of `chart:graph` elements; the graph is described by the `chart:graph` element.
** The `type` attribute defines the type of the graph and can be: line, column, step line, smoothed line, olhc and candlestick.
** The `valueField` attribute defines a key from the list of pairs contained in the `DataItem` objects listed in a `DataProvider` instance; this key is used to determine the value of a pie chart slice.
** The `fillAlphas` attribute defines opacity of fill.
** The `lineAlpha` attribute defines opacity the line (or column border). Value range is 0 - 1.
** The `hidden` attribute specifies whether the graph is hidden.

* `chart:categoryAxis` - an element that describes the category axis.
** Setting `startOnAxis` to *true* causes drawing the chart right from the value axis. The default value for this attribute is `false`. In this case, there will be a small gap between the value axis and the chart.
** The `gridAlpha` attribute defines opacity of grid lines.
** The `axisColor` attribute defines axis color.

* `chart:export` – an optional element that enables chart export.

[[cdp_screen_controller]]
====== Screen Controller

Open the *Controller* tab and replace its content with the following code:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/chart/StackedAreaChart.java[]
----

The `init(Map<String, Object> params)` method submits data to the chart as a rolling value. This type of charts shows the ratio of separate parts to their total value.

[[cdp_result]]
===== Result

. Open the *Main Menu* tab in CUBA Studio and click *edit* button for `web-menu.xml`.

. Choose *`application`* item and click *new* button.

. In *Create menu item* dialog choose `stackedarea-chart` for *id* field and click *add*.

. Select *Run* -> *Start application server*.

After logging in and opening the screen from the application menu you will see the chart like below:

.Column 3D Chart
image::chart/stackedarea-chart.svg[align="center"]

[[section_use_of_events]]
==== Using Events

Let us consider the use of events. We will add handling of a graph item click to the screen created in <<cdb_creating_chart>>. Open the screen controller in the IDE and inject the chart:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
private Chart chart;
----

Then add a listener at the bottom of the `init(Map<String, Object> params)` method:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/chart/GraphItemClickListener.java[]
----

To see the results, rebuild the project using *Run* -> *Restart application server* and log in to the system. Open the screen and click one of the columns.
