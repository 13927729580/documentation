The chart interfaces are implemented in the following Chart components:

* <<gauge_chart,AngularGaugeChart>>;
* <<funnel_chart,FunnelChart>>;
* <<gantt_chart,GanttChart>>;
* <<pie_chart,PieChart>>;
* <<radar_chart,RadarChart>>;
* <<serial_chart,SerialChart>>;
* <<xy_chart,XYChart>>.

All these components have `NAME` constant, so they can be created using `UiComponents`.
