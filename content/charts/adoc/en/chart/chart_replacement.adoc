=== Replacing AmCharts Version

An instance of AmCharts library included in CUBA platform can be replaced with another one. To do this:

. Download charts and stock charts from https://www.amcharts.com/download/[AmCharts site^].
. Merge `amcharts` folder from both archives into one.
. Copy `amcharts` folder to `{project.rootDir}/modules/web/web/VAADIN/webjars`
. Redeploy the application.

To use new attributes added in a new version you need to set custom JSON in your screen controller as shown below.

[source, java]
----
chart.setNativeJson("{\"valueScrollbar\":{\"autoGridCount\":true}}");
----
