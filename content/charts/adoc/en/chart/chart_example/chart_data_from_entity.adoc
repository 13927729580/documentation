==== Creating Chart with Data from an Entity

In this chapter we will create the chart similar to https://www.amcharts.com/demos/3d-stacked-column-chart/[3D Stacked Column Chart^] from AmCharts demos. This chart will retrieve data from a database, so the `datasource` attribute has to be defined. The `JavaScript` source code which amCharts use to define such chart is as follows:

[source,javascript]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/chart/column3d-chart.js[]

include::chart_data_from_entity/cdb_create_model.adoc[]

include::chart_data_from_entity/cdb_creating_chart.adoc[]

include::chart_data_from_entity/cdb_result.adoc[]
