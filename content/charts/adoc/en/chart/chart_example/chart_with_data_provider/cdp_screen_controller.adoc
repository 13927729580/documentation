===== Screen Controller

Open the `StackedareaChart` screen controller and replace its content with the following code:

----
include::{sourcesdir}/chart/StackedAreaChart.java[]
----

The `onInit` method submits data to the chart as a rolling value. This type of charts shows the ratio of separate parts to their total value.
