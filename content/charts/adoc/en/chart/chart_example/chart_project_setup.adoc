==== Setting up the Application Project

. Run CUBA Studio, create a new project as described in the {studio_man_url}/create_project.html[Creating a New Project] section of the {studio_man_url}/index.html[CUBA Studio User Guide] and name it `sampler`.

. Open the *Project Properties* editor in CUBA Studio: click *CUBA -> Project Properties* main menu item. Add the *charts* application component in the *App components* list. Confirm when Studio suggests recreating Gradle scripts.

. Click *CUBA* -> *Build Tasks* -> *Deploy*. At this point, the application will be assembled and deployed to the Tomcat application server located at `build/tomcat`.

Once the steps above are complete, the chart display functionality will be connected to the application and ready to be used.
