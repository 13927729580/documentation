==== Custom Aggregator and Derived Properties

Below is an example of the `pivotTable` which differs from the <<chart_PivotTable_example,example above>> in the custom aggregator and derived properties added in the Java-controller of the screen.

[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/chart/pivot_table_2.xml[]
----

The sorting and aggregation functions can be set either in the XML-descriptor or in the Java-controller. In this example JavaScript functions are passed as parameters to the `JsFunction` class constructor.

Derived properties can be defined in the screen controller as well.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/chart/pivot_table_2.java[]
----

The result:
