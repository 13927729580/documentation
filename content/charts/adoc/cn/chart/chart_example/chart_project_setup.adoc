[[chart_project_setup]]
==== Setting up the Application Project

. Run *CUBA Studio*, create new project and name it `sampler`.

. Open *Project properties* -> *Edit* and select the *charts* component in the list of *App components*; save changes.
Confirm when Studio will suggest recreating Gradle scripts.

. Select *Run* -> *Deploy*. At this point, the application will be assembled and deployed to the Tomcat application
server located at `build/tomcat`.

. Select *Build* -> *Create or update IDEA project files* to create project files for *IntelliJ IDEA*.

Once the steps above are complete, the chart display functionality will be connected to the application and ready to be used.
