=== BpmActivitiListener

The `BpmActivitiListener` event listener is automatically added to the process when a model is created. `BpmActivitiListener` implements the `ActivitiEventListener` interface (see http://www.activiti.org/userguide/#eventDispatcher). The listener is responsible for creating and modifying BPM entities when some process events occur (e.g. a user task entering, process cancellation, task completion, etc). This is the listener that creates <<ProcTask,ProcTask>> objects and sets the `endDate` value for a <<ProcInstance,ProcInstance>>.
