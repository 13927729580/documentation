[[script_execution]]
=== Script Evaluation

The *Script task* node is used to evaluate a script. The system analyzes the content of the *Script* property value. If the value is a valid file path and the file exists, then the script from the file will be executed, otherwise the *Script* field will be evaluated.

Note that you can use `persistence` and `metadata` objects in scripts.
