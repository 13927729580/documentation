=== Completing a Task by Timer

To complete a task after a certain time interval, you should:

* Add the *Boundary timer event* node to the task node.
* Draw the flow from the timer node to another required node.
* Define an expression for the time interval in the *Time duration* property of the timer node. For example `PT15M` is an expression for 15 minutes interval.
* Set the *Cancel activity* property to true. It will cancel the current task when the timer is fired.
* In the *Timer outcome* property, define the task outcome that should be used when the task is completed by the timer.

Defining an outcome for the timer:

[source, xml]
----
<boundaryEvent id="managerApprovalTimer" cancelActivity="true" attachedToRef="managerApproval">
    <extensionElements>
        <cuba:outcome>approve</cuba:outcome>
    </extensionElements>
</boundaryEvent>
----

By default, the Job executor for processing timers is disabled. To enable it, set the application property `bpm.activiti.asyncExecutorEnabled = true`.
