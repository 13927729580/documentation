==== Process Model Deployment

The model deployment process consists of the following steps:

* Generating a process XML in BPMN 2.0 notation from the model.
* Deploying the process to Activiti engine internal tables.
* Creating a `ProcDefinition` object that relates to the Activiti process.
* Creating `ProcRole` objects for process roles defined in the model.

Select the model in the list on the *Process Models* screen. Press the *Deploy* button. The model deployment window will be displayed. The model is deployed for the first time, so the *Create new process* option is selected. You will be able to deploy the model to existing processes for further model changes. Click *OK*. The process definition is created.

Open the screen *BPM -> Process Definitions*. Open the `Contract approval` item for editing. The *Code* field value is `contractApproval`. Remember this value - we will use it to identify the process definition later in this chapter.
