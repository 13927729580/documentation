==== Creating a Contract and Starting the Process

* Open the *Application -> Contracts* screen and create a new contract. Fill in the *Number* and *Date* fields and click *Save*.
* Click *Start process* button, the start process form should appear. During the model creation we defined the `Standard form` with attributes `procActorsVisible=true` and `attachmentsVisible=true` for the *Start event* node. That's why now we see the form with the process actors and attachments tables.
* Enter a comment and add actors: the controller is `norman` and the two managers are `pierce` and `roberts`.
* Add an attachment by using an *Upload* button from the attachments table.
