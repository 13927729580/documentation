==== Controller Validation Stage

Log in as `norman`.

When the process reaches the *User task* node, a `ProcTask` object is created. This object is linked to the particular process actor. The BPM add-on has a screen for displaying uncompleted tasks for the current user: *BPM > Process Tasks*.

We see that the user `norman` has one uncompleted task `Validation` of the `Contract approval` process. Select it and click the *Open entity editor* button. The contract edit screen will appear:

.Contract Edit Validation

The current user (`norman`) has an uncompleted task (ProcTask), so the `procActionsFragment` displays available process actions. When we were defining the `Validation` UserTask node, we set two possible outcomes: `Valid` and `Not valid`. That's why two buttons are added to the `procActionsFragment`.

Click the *Valid* button and enter a comment in the opened window:

.Validation Complete Form

Click *OK*.

After the successful validation, the contract should go to the parallel approval by managers.
