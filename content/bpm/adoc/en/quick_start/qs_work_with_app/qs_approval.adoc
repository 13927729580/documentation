==== Manager Approval Stage

Log in as the `pierce` user.

Open the list of tasks for the current user: *BPM > Process tasks*. You can see the `Approval` task.

.Task List Approval

Select the task and this time click the *Open process instance* button. The system screen for working with the process instance will be opened.

.ProcInstance Edit Approval

It displays the information about the process start time, initiator, attachments list, actors and process instance tasks list. The screen also allows you to open a linked entity editor and execute a process action.

Pay attention to the *Tasks* table. The previous task `Validation` has been completed with the `Valid` outcome, and two new `Approval` tasks have been created for managers `pierce` and `roberts`.

Approve the contract pressing the *Approve* button.

Then log in as `roberts`. Open the contract from the list in *Application > Contracts*.

User `roberts` has an uncompleted task, so the `procActionsFragment` displays *Approve* and *Reject* actions. Click the *Reject* button.

.Approval Form

When we were defining the `Reject` outcome in the model designer, we set the `commentRequired` form parameter to `true`, therefore you see that the comment is required in the task complete form. Enter the comment and press *OK*.

One of the managers has rejected the contract, so the `Not approved` state should be assigned to the contract. Let's check it. Open the contract.

.Not Approved

The approval process is completed with the `Not approved` state.
