NOTE: Attributes whose names start with *act prefix, are references to identifiers from Activiti.

* ProcModel - the process model. Model attributes:
**  name - the model name.
**  description - the model description.
**  actModelId - the ID of the model from Activiti engine in ACT_RE_MODEL table.
* ProcDefinition - the process definition. It can be get from the model, or uploaded from an XML file directly. Entity attributes:
** name - the process name.
** code - the process code. It can be used for searching an entity instance from the application code.
** actId - the ID of the process from Activiti. It is necessary for accessing the BPMN model (extensionElements are read from it).
** active - defines, whether a new process instance start for the current ProcDefinition is allowed.
** procRoles - the collection of objects that define process actors.
** model - the reference to a model the process definition was get from.
* ProcRole - the process role. Objects of this type are created automatically on process deployment. ProcRole defines a process actor type. Entity attributes:
** name - the role name.
** code - the role code. It can be used by the application for a role identification.
** order - the order number. It can be used by the application for displaying roles in an appropriate order.
** procDefinition - the reference to a process definition.
* ProcInstance - the process instance. A ProcInstance can be started both with a link to a project entity and without a link. For example, a contract approval process instance can be linked with a contract entity. Entity attributes:
** description - the description of the process instance.
** startDate - the process instance start date.
** endDate - the process instance end date
** startedBy - the user who started the process.
** active - the indicator that a process was started but wasn't completed yet.
** cancelled - the indicator that a process was canceled.
** actProcessInstanceId - the identifier of the corresponding ProcessInstance from Activiti.
** startComment - the comment on process start.
** cancelComment - the comment on process cancel.
** entityName - the linked entity name.
** entityId - the linked entity ID.
** entityEditorName - the screen name that will be used for editing a linked entity. Fill it if a screen name differs from the standard one.
** procTasks - the process tasks collection.
** procActors - the process actors collection.
** procAttachments - the process attachments collection.
* ProcActor - the process participant. The entity defines an executor with a particular role for a process instance. Entity attributes:
** user - the reference to a user.
** procInstance - the reference to a process instance.
** procRole - the reference to a process role.
** order - the order number. The field is used to define an actors order for a sequential task for multiple users.
* ProcTask - the process task. Objects of this type are automatically created when a process reaches a User task node. Entity attributes:
** name - the task name.
** startDate - the task start date.
** claimDate - the claim date. The field is used in a case of a task without an explicit process actor.
** endDate - the task end date.
** outcome - the task completion result (the outcome the user has used for completing a task).
** comment - the task completion comment.
** procActor - the executor.
** actTaskId - the Activiti task ID. This field is used when signaling to Activiti engine about a task completion.
** actExecutionId - the Activiti execution ID. This field is used for a process variables reading/writing.
** actTaskDefinitionKey - in a process XML it is an `id` attribute of a UserTask element. It is used for building a name of a variable, that stores a task result (`[task_id]_result`). See <<functionality.adoc#transitions>>.
** cancelled - the identifier that the task was completed on process cancelation.
** candidateUsers - the list of possible process actors for a group task.
** procInstance - the reference to a process instance.
* ProcAttachment - the process attachment. Entity attributes:
** file - the reference to FileDescriptor.
** type - the attachment type (ProcAttachmentType).
** comment - the comment.
** author - the attachment author, a reference to a user.
** procInstance - the reference to a process instance.
** procTask - the optional reference to a process task.
* ProcAttachmentType - the attachment type. Entity attributes:
** code - the attachment type code.
** name - the attachment type name.
