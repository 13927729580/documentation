[[process_runtime_service]]
=== ProcessRuntimeService

It is designed to work with process instances. The service methods allow you to:

* <<task_execution_sample,start a process>>
* cancel a process
* complete a task
* assign a task to the user

When a process is started, the following process variables are created automatically:

* `bpmProcInstanceId` - `ProcInstance` object ID
* `entityName` - linked entity name
* `entityId` - linked entity ID

To access the service functionality on middleware, use the `ProcessRuntimeManager` bean.
