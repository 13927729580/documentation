[[process_repository_service]]
=== ProcessRepositoryService

It is designed to work with process definitions. The service is used to:

* load a process definition from XML;
* undeploy a process from Activiti engine;
* transform the JSON model to BPMN XML.

To access the service functionality on middleware, use the `ProcessRepositoryManager` bean.
