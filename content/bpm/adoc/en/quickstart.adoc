[[quick-start]]
== Quick Start

In this chapter, we will cover a creating of a small project that demonstrates a working with business processes. The task is to implement a contract approval process. The process looks like this:

* A user creates a Contract object, defines process actors and starts an approval process.
* A process actor with a `Controller` role receives a task to check an attached contract correctness.
* If the validation is passed then the contract goes to users with `Manager` role. If managers approval fails, then the process finishes and `Not valid` state is assigned to the contract.
* After managers approval or rejection, the contract gets into the state `Approved` or `Not approved`.

[[qs-project-creating]]
=== Creating the Project
. Create a new project in Cuba Studio. Project name: `bpm-demo`, Project namespace: `demo`

image::StudioNewProject.png[]

[start=2]
. Open the project properties window (*Project properties* section, *Edit* button)
. Activate the BPM module in the *Base projects* list

image::StudioSelectBpmModule.png[]

[start=4]
. Press *OK* button at the project properties page. The system will ask you for the confirmation. Agree.

[[qs-data-model-creating]]
=== Creating the Data Model

Go to the *Entities* tab and press *New entity*. The class name is `Contract`.

image::CreateContractEntity.png[]

Create the following entity attributes::

* `number` (`String` type)
* `date` (`Date` type)
* `state` (`String` type)

image::ContractEntityAttributes.png[]

Go to the *Instance name* tab. In the *Name pattern field* enter the value `Contract %s` and add a `number` attribute to *Name pattern attributes*.

image::ContractEntityNamePattern.png[]

Save the entity by pressing the *OK* button.

[[qs-standard-screen-creating]]
=== Standard screens creating

In the *Entities* section of navigator panel select the Contract entity and press *Generate standard screens* button. Default values of the screen creating window suits us, so just press *Create*.

image::CreateContractScreens.png[]

[[qs-beans-creating]]
=== Creating Business Logic Beans

==== ApprovalHelper Bean

An `updateState()` method of `ApprovalHelper` bean will be invoked from the contract approval process for setting a contract state.

.Method parameters:
* `entityId` - contract entity identifier
* `state` - contract state

Open the project in an IDE. A simple way to do is is to use an *IDE* button from any section of the Studio navigator, e.g. *Project properties*.

Create a package `com.company.demo.core` in the `core` module. Create `ApprovalHelper` class in this package.

.ApprovalHelper.java
[source,java]
----
package com.company.demo.core;

import com.company.demo.entity.Contract;
import com.haulmont.cuba.core.EntityManager;
import com.haulmont.cuba.core.Persistence;
import com.haulmont.cuba.core.Transaction;
import javax.annotation.ManagedBean;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import java.util.UUID;

@ManagedBean("demo_ApprovalHelper")
public class ApprovalHelper {

    @Inject
    private Persistence persistence;

    public void updateState(UUID entityId, String state) {
        Transaction tx = persistence.getTransaction();
        try {
            EntityManager em = persistence.getEntityManager();
            Contract contract = em.find(Contract.class, entityId);
            if (contract != null) {
                contract.setState(state);
            }
            tx.commit();
        } finally {
            tx.end();
        }
    }
}
----

[[qs-run-app]]
=== Creating the Database and Running the Application

Press the *Generate DB scripts* button of *Entities* navigator section. In the database manager window press the *Create database* button.

image::StudioCreateDatabase.png[]

Start the server with *Run -> Start application server* command.

Open the application in a browser by typing the address http://localhost:8080/app or just click the link in the bottom of Studio navigator panel.

[[qs-process-creating]]
=== Creating the Process

[[qs-process-model-creating]]
==== Creating the Process model

A final version of process model will look like this:

image::ProcessFull.png[]

Let's look at the sequence of steps for the model creating.

Open the screen *BPM -> Process models* in the running application web interface and press *Create*. Enter the model name `Contract approval` and press *OK*. A new browser tab *Model editor* will be opened.

Select a *Process roles* property in a model properties panel. A process roles edit window will be opened.

image::ProcessRolesProperty.png[]

There should be 2 types of actors in the process: a manager and a controller. Create 2 roles: `Controller` and `Manager`.

image::ProcessRolesEditor.png[]

Drag and drop a *Start event* node from the *Start Events* group to the workspace. We need to display a form for a process actors selecting on process start. Select the start event node. Select the *Start form* in its properties panel - a form selection window will be opened. Select `Standard form` in a *Form name* field. Then add 2 form parameters:

* `procActorsVisible` with `true` value indicates that a table for process actors selecting will be displayed on the form
* `attachmentsVisible` with `true` value indicates that a table for attachments upload will be displayed on the form

image::StartForm.png[]

Add a *User task* node from an *Activities* group to the model. Name it `Validation`.

image::ModelValidationNode.png[]

Select this node and assign a value `controller` to the *Process role* property at the properties panel. This is how we defined that the task will be assigned to a process actor with `controller` role.

image::SelectProcRoleForValidation.png[]

Next select a Task outcomes property. A window for task outcomes edit will be opened. Outcomes define possible users actions when users receive tasks.  Create 2 outcomes: Valid and Not valid. For both of them define a form Standard form. Add form parameter commentRequired = true for the Not valid outcome. It is required to make a user add a comment in case of invalid contract.

image::OutcomesForValidation.png[]

Depending on controller's decision we have to send the contract to managers approval or to finish the process setting a state `Not valid` to the contract beforehand. An *Exclusive gateway* node from the *Gateways* group is used to control a process flow. Add it to the workspace and then add 2 more elements: a *Script task* with a `Set 'Not valid' state` name and a *User task* with `Approval` name. Name a flow to the Script task `Not valid` and a flow to the User task should be named `Valid`.

image::ModelValidationExclGateway.png[]

Select the `Not valid` flow. Expand the dropdown list *Flow outcome* from the properties panel. It shows outcomes from the tasks before the gateway. Select the `Not valid` value.

image::NotValidFlowOutcome.png[]

Now if a user selects the `Not valid` outcome, a transition on this flow will be performed.

The `Valid` flow will be a default flow (if no other flows condition are true). Select the `Valid` flow and set its *Default flow* property for that.

Next select the Exclusive gateway and open its *Flow order* property editor. Make sure that the `Not valid` flow goes on the first place in a list. If it is not true then change the flows sequence.

image::ValidationFlowOrder.png[]

Let's move to the `Set 'Not valid' state` node. We need to set a state property of the Contract entity to the `Not valid` value. Select the node. Set *Script format* property value to `groovy`, because we will write a groovy script. Click on the *Script* property field - a script edit window will be opened. Copy and paste the following code there:

[source,groovy]
----
import com.company.demo.entity.Contract

def em = persistence.getEntityManager()
def contract = em.find(Contract.class, entityId)
contract.setState('Not valid')
----

It is possible to use process variables and platform objects `persistence` and `metadata` (see http://www.cuba-platform.com/ru/manual[CUBA Platform. Developer's Manual]) inside scripts. An `entityId` variable is created on process start and stores an identifier of the linked entity.

After the contract state is changed, a process should be finished. Let's add an *End event* node from the *End events* group to the workspace and connect the node with the `Set 'Not valid' state`.

Let's go back to the `Approval` task. Define a process role for it like you did for the first task, but now the role is `manager`. Because the task is supposed to be assigned to many managers simultaneously, set its *Multi-instance type* property to `Parallel`. 

image::ApprovalMutlInstanceType.png[]

Create 2 task outcomes: `Approve` and `Reject` (*Task outcomes* property). For both outcomes set `Standard form` form and set `commentRequired` parameter to `true` for the `Reject` outcome.

After the approval is completed, a state `Approved` or `Not approved` should be assigned to the contract depending on the approval result. Add an *Exclusive gateway* node after the `Approval task`. Add 2 *Service task* after the exclusive gateway: `Set 'Approved' state` and `Set 'Not approved' state`. They will do the same things as the Script task added earlier, but in another way. They will invoke a Spring bean method. Name a flow to the `Set 'Approved' state` `Approved`, and name the flow to the `Set 'Not approved' state` `Not approved`.

image::ModelWithApproval.png[]

Select the flow node `Not approved`, and in a *Flow outcome* list select a value `Reject`. Now if even one of the managers will do a `Reject` action, then this outcome will be initiated. Select the `Approved` flow node and check the *Default flow* checkbox. This means that if no other flow is initiated then this flow will be used.

Set flow order for the Exclusive gateway like you did for the previous one. Select the Exclusive gateway, and open a *Flow order* property editor. `Not approved` should be processed first.

image::ApprovalFlowOrder.png[]

Let's go back to the Service task. Select the `Set 'Approved' state` node and set its *Expression property* the following value:

[source,groovy]
----
${demo_ApprovalHelper.updateState(entityId, 'Approved')}
----

For the `Set 'Not approved' state`:

[source,groovy]
----
${demo_ApprovalHelper.updateState(entityId, 'Not approved')}
----

Activiti engine is integrated with the String framework, so we can access Spring managed beans by their names. `entityId` is a process variable that stores an identifier of a contract linked to the process. Its value is set on a process start.

Connect the 2 Service tasks with the End event, and press a save model button. Model is ready. Move to a model deployment.

image::ProcessFull.png[]

==== Process Model Deployment

The process of a model deployment consists of the following steps:

* Generating a process XML in BPMN 2.0 notation from the model.
* Deploying the process to Activiti engine internal tables.
* Creating a ProcDefinition object, that relates to the Activiti process.
* Creating ProcRole objects for process roles defined in the model.

Select the model in a list on *Process models* screen. Press *Deploy* button. A model deployment window will be displayed. The model is deployed for the first time, so the *Create new process* option is selected. You will be able to deploy the model to existing processes on next model changes. Click *OK*. The process is created.

image::DeployModelScreen.png[]

Open the screen *BPM -> Process Definitions*. Open the item 'Contract approval' for editing. Change the *Code* field value to `contractApproval`. We will search a process definition object by this code leter in this chapter.

image::ProcDefinitionEdit.png[]

[[qs-screens-adaptation]]
=== Adapting Screens to the Process

In this section, we will add an ability to work with the contract approval process to the contract edit screen.

[[qs-contract-edit-descriptor]]
==== Contract Editor Screen Layout

Save the changes by pressing *OK*.

Let's examine the controller code in details.

To start the process, we have to create a process instance (ProcInstance object), link it to a process definition (ProcDefinition object), and perform a start. A process instance can be started both without a link to any project entity and with this link. In our case a link to the contract is necessary.

In the beginning of the `postInit()` method an instance of contract approval process is searched. The `findProcDefinition()` method searches for a process definition by `contractApproval` code. Next, there is a check whether a ProcInstance object linked with the contract exists in the database (`findProcInstance()` method). If the process instance object doesn't exist then it is created, a relation to ProcDefinition is set, and a linked entity name and identifier are filled.

[source,java]
----
if (procInstance == null) {
    procInstance = metadata.create(ProcInstance.class);
    procInstance.setProcDefinition(procDefinition);
    procInstance.setEntityName("demo$Contract");
    procInstance.setEntityId(getItem().getId());
}
----

`CommitListener` adds the created ProcInstance object to the list of entities 
that will be sent to the middleware for the commit.

[source,java]
----
getDsContext().addListener(new DsContext.CommitListenerAdapter() {
    @Override
    public void beforeCommit(CommitContext context) {
        if (procInstance != null && PersistenceHelper.isNew(procInstance)) {
            context.getCommitInstances().add(procInstance);
        }
    }
});
----

Next, go to the `initProcActionsFrame()` method.

A `ProcActionsFrame` is a standard frame for displaying the buttons with available process actions. `ProcActionsFrame` is linked with a `ProcInstance` instance. If the process is not started yet, the frame will display a start process button. If the process is started and there are active tasks for the current user, then the frame will display buttons for task completion according to the task outcomes defined in the process model. For the detailed information about ProcActionsFrame see <<ui.adoc#proc-actions-frame>>.

[source, java]
----
private void initProcActionsFrame() {
    procActionsFrame.setBeforeStartProcessPredicate(new ProcAction.BeforeActionPredicate() {
        @Override
        public boolean evaluate() {
            if (PersistenceHelper.isNew(getItem())) {
                showNotification(getMessage("saveContract"), NotificationType.WARNING);
                return false;
            }
            return true;
        }
    });
    procActionsFrame.setAfterStartProcessListener(new ProcAction.AfterActionListener() {
        @Override
        public void actionCompleted() {
            showNotification(getMessage("processStarted"), NotificationType.HUMANIZED);
            close(COMMIT_ACTION_ID);
        }
    });
    procActionsFrame.setBeforeCompleteTaskPredicate(new ProcAction.BeforeActionPredicate() {
        @Override
        public boolean evaluate() {
            return commit();
        }
    });
    procActionsFrame.setAfterCompleteTaskListener(new ProcAction.AfterActionListener() {
        @Override
        public void actionCompleted() {
            showNotification(getMessage("taskCompleted"), NotificationType.HUMANIZED);
            close(COMMIT_ACTION_ID);
        }
    });
    procActionsFrame.setCancelProcessEnabled(false);
    procActionsFrame.init(procInstance);
}
----

The `procActionsFrame.setBeforeStartProcessPredicate()` method adds the check that is performed before the process is started. If the contract is not saved yet, the process will not start and a warning message will be shown.

The `procActionsFrame.setBeforeCompleteTaskPredicate()` method invokes an editor commit and allows to complete a process action only if the editor commit was successful. 

`setAfterProcessStartListener` and `setAfterCompleteTaskListener` methods will be invoked after corresponding events. They will show a notification and close a contract editor.

After all necessary listeners and predicates are set up, a frame initialization is invoked.

[source,java]
----
procActionsFrame.init(procInstance);
----

Required frame UI components are created during the frame initialization.

[[qs-localization]]
==== Localized Messages File

In Studio, open the `messages.properties` file from a package with contract screens. Replace its content with the following text:

[source]
----
messages.properties
browseCaption = Contract browser
editCaption = Contract editor
attachments = Attachments
process = Contract approval
saveContract = Save the contract before starting a process
processStarted = Process started
taskCompleted = Task completed
----

[[qs-work-with-app]]
=== Working With the Application

Hot deploy mechanism is enabled in Studio by default, so all changes should be already sent to the application server. If Hot Deploy was disabled then restart the server in Studio with a command *Run -> Restart application server*.

[[qs-users-creating]]
==== Creating Users

We have to create test users for the process demonstration. Open the *Administration -> Users* screen and create 3 users:

* login: `norman`, First name: `Tommy`, Last name: `Norman`, Full name: `Tommy Norman`
* login: `roberts`, First name: `Casey`, Last name: `Roberts`, Full name: `Casey Roberts`
* login: `pierce`, First name: `Walter`, Last name: `Pierce`, Full name: `Walter Pierce`

[[qs-start-process]]
==== Creating the Contract and Starting the Process

* Open the contract list *Application -> Contracts* and create a new contract. Fill *Number* and *Date* fields, and click *Save* button.
* Click *Start process* button and a start process form should appear. During the model creating we defined a form `Standard form` with attributes `procActorsVisible=true` and `attachmentsVisible=true` for the *Start event* node. That's why now we see a form with a process actors table and an attachments table.
* Enter a comment and add actors: the controller is `norman` and the 2 managers are `pierce` and `roberts`.
* Add an attachment by using an *Upload* button from attachments table.

image::StartProcessForm.png[]

[start=5]
. Press *OK* - the process is started.

[[qs-validation]]
==== Controller Validation Stage

Log in with user `norman`.

When a process reaches a User task node, a ProcTask object is created. This object is linked with the particular process actor. The BPM module has a screen for displaying the uncompleted tasks for the current user. Open it: *BPM -> Process tasks*.

image::ProcTaskBrowse.png[]

Wee see that the user `norman` has one uncompleted task `Validation` from the `Contract approval` process. Select it and click on the *Open process instance* button. A system screen for working with a process instance will be opened.

image::ProcInstanceEdit.png[]

It displays the information about a process start time, a process initiator, an attachments list, an actors list, a list of the process instance current and completed tasks. The screen also allows you to open the linked entity editor (`Contract 001`) and execute a process action. We will complete a process task in another way - with a `procActionsFrame` we added earlier to the contract editor.

Close the *Process Instance Edit* screen and open the contract instance.

The current user (`norman`) has an uncompleted task (ProcTask), so the `procActionsFrame` displays available process actions. When we were defining a UserTask node `Validation`, we set 2 outcomes for it: `Valid` and `Not valid`. That's why 2 buttons are added to the `procActionsFrame`.

Click *Valid* button. In the opened window enter the following comment:

Click *OK*.

 After the successful validation the contract should go to managers parallel approval.

==== Manager Approval Stage

Log in with user `pierce`.

Open a current tasks list *BPM -> Process tasks*. There is a task `Approval` there.

Open the *Process Instance Editor*.

Pay attention to the *Tasks* table. The previous task `Validation` has been completed with a `Valid` outcome, and 2 new tasks `Approval` were created for managers `pierce` and `roberts`.

Approve the contract using the *Approve* button.

Then log in with user `roberts`. Open the contract from a list *Application -> Contracts*.

User `roberts` has an uncompleted task, so the `procActionsFrame` displays actions *Approve* and *Reject* for him. Click the *Reject* button.

When we had been defining a `Reject` outcome in a model designer, we set a `commentRequired` form parameter to `true`, therefore you see that the comment is required in the task complete form. Enter the comment and press *OK*.

One of the managers has rejected the contract, so the `Not approved` state should be assigned to it. Let's check it. Open the contract.

The approval process is completed, and the `endDate` field of the contract linked with the procInstance object is filled.
