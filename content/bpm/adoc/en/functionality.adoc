[[functionality]]
== BPM Module Functionality

The BPM module uses the Activiti Engine for business processes execution. The modified editor from Activiti Explorer is used for modeling processes in BPMN 2.0 notation. In addition to Activiti framework abilities, a BPM module provides an additional functionality described in this section. A description of Activiti framework is out of this manual scope. You can familiarize with it on Activiti website: http://www.activiti.org/userguide.

[[bpm-activiti-listener]]
=== Event Listener BpmActivitiListener

The `BpmActivitiListener` is automatically added to the process when a model is created. `BpmActivitiListener` implements the `ActivitiEventListener` interface (see http://www.activiti.org/userguide/#eventDispatcher). The listener is responsible for creating and modifying BPM entities when some process events occur, e.g. entering a user task, process cancelation, task completion, etc.). This is the listener that creates ProcTasks objects and sets the `endDate` value for a ProcInstance.

[[process-roles]]
=== Process Roles

Process roles define process actors types, e.g. operator or manager. To open a process roles edit window, select the *Process roles* property in the model properties panel. An information about the roles will be written to the process XML (`extensionElements` section of the `process` element) during a model deployment.

.Process roles definition in a process XML
[source.xml]
----
<process id="testProcess" name="Test process">
    <extensionElements>
         <cuba:procRoles>
            <cuba:procRole name="Manager" code="manager"/>
            <cuba:procRole name="Operator" code="operator"/>
        </cuba:procRoles>
    </extensionElements>
</process>
----

[[start-process-form]]
=== Start Process Form

To define a form that will be displayed on a process start, use a *Start form* property of a *Start event* node. Read mode about forms in a  <<ui.adoc#process-forms>> section.

.Process start form definition in a process XML
[source, xml]
----
<startEvent id="startEvent">
  <extensionElements>
    <cuba:form name="standardProcForm">
      <cuba:param name="procActorsVisible" value="true"></cuba:param>
    </cuba:form>
  </extensionElements>
</startEvent>
----

[[user-task]]
=== User Task

To define a task assignee, select one of the process roles in a *Process role* property of a *User task* node. When a process will reach a User task, process actors with the given role will be found among all process actors, and the task will be assigned to them.

.Process role form a task in a process XML

----
<userTask id="managerApproval" name="Manager approval">
    <extensionElements>
        <cuba:procRole>manager</cuba:procRole> 
    </extensionElements>
</process>
----

If you want the task to be assigned to multiple users, then set a `Parallel` or `Sequential` value to the *Multi-instance type* property of the *User task* node.

Set the *Claim allowed* property to if you want the task not to be immediately assigned to the particular user, but to appear in a list of available tasks for a group of users. Then of the candidates will be able to claim the task. Task candidates are process actors with a role from the *Process role* property.

        <cuba:claimAllowed>true</cuba:claimAllowed>
    </extensionElements>
</process>

[[task-outcomes]]
=== Task outcomes

As a rule a task expects the user to make a decision, e.g. to approve or to reject the contract. The next route through the process depends on this decision. *Task outcomes* property of a *User task* node is used for defining a list of outcomes. A name and a form, that should be displayed when selecting this outcome, can be defined for each outcome. List of form parameters can be defined as well (see <<ui.adoc#process-forms>>).

                    <cuba:param name="commentRequired">true</cuba:param>
                    <cuba:param name="attachmentsVisible">true</cuba:param>
                </cuba:form>
            </cuba:outcome>
            <cuba:outcome name="reject">
                <cuba:form name="someOtherProcessForm">
                </cuba:form>
            </cuba:outcome>
        </cuba:outcomes>
    </extensionElements>
</process>

[[transitions]]
=== Transitions Depending on Task Outcomes

Unlike jBPM, BPMN 2.0 notation doesn't provide a way to define multiple outcomes for a User task. To make a process continue on a required flow node, an *Exclusive gateway* is used. Its outgoing flows have conditions that operates with results of the preceding task. When the user completes the task, the task result is written to the process variable with a name `[taskId]_result`. The variable type is `ProcTaskResult`.

Methods of `ProcTaskResult` class:

* `int count(String outcomeName)` - returns a number of users who completed the task with a given outcome.
* `boolean exists(String outcomeName)` - returns `true` if there are users who completed the task with a given outcome.

An object with a result is used in a *Flow condition* expression for a gateway outgoing flows.

Example:

image::TaskOutcomesExample.png[]

Let's suppose that the `approval` task was assigned to multiple uses in parallel. There are 2 outcomes defined for the task: `approve` and `reject`. After all users complete the task, the process will go to the exclusive gateway. We need the next behavior: if anyone choses the `reject` option then go to the `Rejected` flow. If everyone approved then go to the `Approved` flow.

==== Defining a Condition in a Flow Outcome Field

The most convenient way to define a condition is to select a name of the previous task outcome in the *Flow outcome* property of the flow node. The flow will be activated if there was at least one task completion with the selected outcome.

==== Defining a Complex Condition for the Flow Node

If you need a more complex condition for the outcome, you can define it in a *Flow condition* field. For example, a condition "More than 5 users selected an option Reject" will look like this:

[source,groovy]
----
${approval_result.count('reject') > 5}
----

==== Flow Order

Please notice that a flow order should be defined. Otherwise, Activiti may process a default flow before the flows with explicit conditions. To define a flow order use a *Flow order* property of an *Exclusive gateway* node. 

[[script-execution]]
=== A Script Evaluation

A *Script task* node is used to evaluate a script. The system analyzes a content of a *Script* property value. If the value is a file path and the file exists, then the script from the file is executed. If there is no file on the given path, then the content of the *Script* field is evaluated.

You can use `persistence` and `metadata` objects inside the script.

[[service-invocation]]
=== Middleware Beans Methods Invocation

A *Service task* node is used to invoke a service method. Activiti engine is integrated with the Spring framework, so you can access middleware beans by their names. To invoke a managed bean method, write the expression like this in the *Expression* field:

[source,groovy]
----
${beanName.methodName(processVarName, 'someStringParam')}
----

[[timer]]
=== Completing a Task by Timer

To complete a task after a time interval, it is necessary to:

* Add a *Boundary timer event* node to the task node.
* Draw a flow from the timer node to the other required node.
* Define an expression for a time interval in the *Time duration* property of the timer node. For example `PT15M` is an expression for 15 minutes interval.
* Set the *Cancel activity* property to true. That will cancel the current task when the timer is fired.
* In a *Timer outcome* property define a task outcome that should be used when completing the task by the timer.

----
<boundaryEvent id="managerApprovalTimer" cancelActivity="true" attachedToRef="managerApproval">
    <extensionElements>
        <cuba:outcome>approve</cuba:outcome>
    </extensionElements>
</boundaryEvent>
----

By default, a Job executor for processing timers is disabled. To enable it, set an application property `bpm.activiti.asyncExecutorEnabled = true`.

[[localization]]
=== Localization

A process may contain localized messages that are used for displaying task or outcomes names in a user interface.

To open the localized messages editor, select the *Localization property* in the model properties panel.

To localize a task name, create a record with a task id as a key.

To localize a task outcome name, create a record with an expression like `TASK_ID.OUTCOME_NAME` as a key.

To localize a process role name, create a record with a role code as a key.

</process>
----

[[submodels]]
=== Submodels

A *Sub model* node of the *Structural group* allows to use an existing model as a part of a new model. When deploying a process, submodel elements are inserted to the current model, and a process XML is produced from the result of this concatenation.
