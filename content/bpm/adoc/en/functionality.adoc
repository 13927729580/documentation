[[functionality]]
== BPM Module Functionality

BPM module uses an Activiti Engine for business processes execution. A modified editor from Activiti Explorer is used for modeling processes in BPMN 2.0 notation. In addition to Activiti framework abilities, a BPM module provides an additional functionality described in this section. A description of Activiti framework is out of this manual scope. You can familiarize with them on Activiti website: http://www.activiti.org/userguide.

[[bpm-activiti-listener]]
=== Event Listener BpmActivitiListener

A BpmActivitiListener is automatically added to the process on a model creating. BpmActivitiListener implements an ActivitiEventListener interface (see http://www.activiti.org/userguide/#eventDispatcher). The listener is responsible for creating and modifying BPM entities when some process events occur, e.g. entering to a user task, process cancelation, task completion, etc.). This is the listener that creates ProcTasks objects and sets endDate values for a ProcInstance.

[[process-roles]]
=== Process Roles

Process roles define process actors types, i.e. operator or manager. To open a process roles edit window, select a 'Process roles' property in a process properties panel. An information about the roles will be written to the process XML (extensionElements section of a process element) during a model deployment and then ProcRoles objects will be created.

.Process roles definition in a process XML
[source.xml]
----
<process id="testProcess" name="Test process">
    <extensionElements>
         <cuba:procRoles>
            <cuba:procRole name="Manager" code="manager"/>
            <cuba:procRole name="Operator" code="operator"/>
        </cuba:procRoles>
    </extensionElements>
</process>
----

[[start-process-form]]
=== Start Process Form

To define a form that will be displayed on a process start, use a Start form property of a Start event node. Read mode about forms in a  <<ui.adoc#process-forms>> section.

.Process start from definition in a process XML
[source, xml]
----
<startEvent id="startEvent">
  <extensionElements>
    <cuba:form name="standardProcForm">
      <cuba:param name="procActorsVisible" value="true"></cuba:param>
    </cuba:form>
  </extensionElements>
</startEvent>
----

[[user-task]]
=== User Task

To define a task assignee, select one of process roles in a Process role property of a User task node. When a process reaches the User task, process actors with the given role will be found among all process actors, and the task will be assigned to them.

.Process role form a task in a process XML
[source, xml]
----
<userTask id="managerApproval" name="Manager approval">
    <extensionElements>
        <cuba:procRole>manager</cuba:procRole> 
    </extensionElements>
</process>
----

If you want the task to be assigned to multiple users, then set a value Parallel or Sequential to the Multi-instance type property of the User task node.

There is also an option when the task shouldn't be immediately assigned to the user, but to appear in a list of available tasks. Then one of the candidates should claim the task. Set a property Claim allowed to define such task. Then the task will appear in a list of available tasks for all users with a role from a Process role property.

</process>

[[task-outcomes]]
=== Task outcomes

As usual a task expects the user to make some decision, e.g. to approve or to reject the contract. The next route through the process depends on this decision. Task outcomes property of User task node is used for defining a list of outcomes. A name and a form, that should be displayed when selecting this outcome, are defined for each outcome. List of form parameters are defined as well (see <<ui.adoc#process-forms>>).

                </cuba:form>
            </cuba:outcome>
            <cuba:outcome name="reject">
                <cuba:form name="someOtherProcessForm">
                </cuba:form>
            </cuba:outcome>
        </cuba:outcomes>
    </extensionElements>
</process>

[[transitions]]
=== Transitions Depending on Task Outcomes

Unlike jBPM, BPMN 2.0 notation doesn't provide a way to define multiple outcomes for a User task. To make a process continue on a required flow node, an Exclusive gateway is used. Its outgoing flows have conditions that operates with results of preceding tasks. When the user finishes the task, the task result is written to the process variable with a name [taskId]_result. The variable type is ProcTaskResult.

ProcTaskResult class methods:

* int count(String outcomeName) - returns a number of users who completed the task with a given outcome.
* boolean exists(String outcomeName) - returns true if there are users who completed the task with a given outcome.

An object with a result is used in a Flow condition expression for a Gateway outgoing flows.

Example:

image::TaskOutcomesExample.png[]

Let's suppose that the Approval task was assigned to multiple uses in parallel. There are 2 outcomes defined for the task: approve and reject. After all users complete the task, the process will go to the exclusive gateway. We need the next behavior: if anyone chose reject outcome then go to Rejected outcome. If everyone approved then go on Approve outcome.

==== Defining a condition in Flow outcome field

The most convenient way to define a condition is to select a name of the previous task outcome in a Flow outcome property of the flow node. The flow will be activated if there was even one task completion with the selected outcome.

==== Defining a Complex Condition for the Flow Node

If you need a more complex condition for the outcome, you can define it in a Flow condition field. For example, a condition "More than 5 users selected an option Reject" will look like this:

[source,groovy]
----
${approval_result.count('reject') > 5}
----

==== Flow Order

Please notice that a flow order should be defined. Otherwise, Activiti may process a default flow before flows with explicitly defined conditions. To define a flow order use a Flow order property of Exclusive gateway node. 

[[script-execution]]
=== A Script Evaluation

A Script task node is used to invoke a evaluate a script. The system analyzes a content of a script property value of the Script task node. If the content is file path and the file exists, then a script from the file is be executed. If there is no file on the given path, then a content of the script field is evaluated.

You can use persistence and metadata objects inside the script.

[[service-invocation]]
=== Service Methods Invocation

A Service task node is used to invoke a service method. Activiti engine is integrated with the Spring framework, so you can access middleware beans by their names. To invoke a managed bean method write the expression like this in the expression field:

[source,groovy]
----
${beanName.methodName(processVarName, 'someStringParam')}
----

[[timer]]
=== Completing a Task by Timer

Для того, чтобы завершить задачу после истечения периода времени необходимо:

* Add a Boundary timer event node to the task node.
* Draw a flow from the timer node to other required node.
* Define an expression for a time interval in a Time duration property of the timer node. For example PT15M is an expression for 15 minutes.
* Set the property Cancel activity. That will cancel the current task when the timer is fired.
* In a Timer outcome property define a task outcome that should be used when completing the task by the timer.

----
<boundaryEvent id="managerApprovalTimer" cancelActivity="true" attachedToRef="managerApproval">
    <extensionElements>
        <cuba:outcome>approve</cuba:outcome>
    </extensionElements>
</boundaryEvent>
----

By default, a Job executor for processing timers is disabled. To enable it, set an application property bpm.activiti.asyncExecutorEnabled = true.

[[localization]]
=== Localization

A process may contain localized messages that are used for displaying task or outcomes names in a user interface.

To open the localized messages editor, select a Localization property of the model.

To localize a task name, create a record with a task id as a key.

To localize a task outcome name, create a record with an expression like TASK_ID.OUTCOME_NAME as a key.

To localize a process role name, create a record with a role code as a key.

</process>

[[submodels]]
=== Submodels

A Sub model node of the Structural group allows to use an existing model as a part of a new model. When deploying a process, submodel elements are inserted to the current model, and a process XML is produced from the result of this concatenation.
