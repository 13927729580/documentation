== Functionality

The BPM subsystem employs the Activiti Engine for execution of business processes. The modified editor from Activiti Explorer is used to model processes using BPMN 2.0 notation. In addition to Activiti framework capabilities, the BPM subsystem provides additional functionality which is described in this section. The description of the Activiti framework is out of scope of this manual and can be found at https://www.activiti.org/userguide/.
