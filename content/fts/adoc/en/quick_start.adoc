== Quick Start

This chapter describes the example of using the full-text search subsystem in the *Library* sample application, which source code is available at https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-library-cuba7[GitHub].

We will split the task into the following stages:

. Enable search functionality for the project, configure the indexing process and verify that it works.
. Adjust the FTS configuration file to include entities from the sample Library data model.
. Use the `BookPublication` entity and the functionality of file upload described in the {main_man_url}/file_storage.html[File Storage] section of the {main_man_url}/index.html[Developer's Manual] to illustrate search function for the loaded files.
