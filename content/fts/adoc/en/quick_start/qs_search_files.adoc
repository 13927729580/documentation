=== Uploaded Files Content Search

Now we need to provide the possibility of file upload for each book publication and to add uploaded files to the `BookPublication` browse screen.

Let us customize `BookPublication` entity. Firstly we add a new `file` attribute which is a many-to-one ASSOCIATION to `FileDescriptor` entity. `FileDescriptor` is the descriptor of the uploaded file (not to be confused with `java.io.FileDescriptor`) that enables referencing the file from the data model objects. Save the changes, then append the new attribute to the existing `bookPublication.full` view and `BookPublication` browse and edit screens with the help of Studio.

Generate new DB scripts, update database and restart application server. If DB is recreated, full text search becomes disabled by default. Check the *Value* checkbox again in *JMX Console*, reindex all files, process indexing queue, log out and log in back.

As far as we have added the new attribute, the table of publications on `BookPublication` browser screen now contains one more column: *File*. To fill it in, open any line for editing, upload a text file using the new upload field and click OK. By default CUBA supports `RTF`, `TXT`, `DOC`, `DOCX`, `XLS`, `XSLX`, `ODT`, `ODS`, and `PDF` file formats.

New files appeared in the table. The appearance of new column can be adjusted.

Open the *JMX Console* screen, open the `app-core.fts:type=FtsManager` JMX bean and invoke sequentially `reindexAll()` and `processQueue()` to re-index the existing instances in the database and files according to the new search configuration. All new and changed data will be indexed automatically with a delay depending on the scheduled task interval, i.e. not longer than 30 seconds.

As a result, *Full text search* will now output all the entries including external files contents.
