=== Project Setup

. Run CUBA Studio, go to *Open project* -> *Samples* window and download the Library project.

. Open the Library project in Studio.

. Open *Project properties* -> *Edit*, select the *fts* component in the list of *App components* and save changes. Confirm when Studio suggests recreating Gradle scripts.

. Select *Run* -> *Deploy*. At this point, the application will be assembled and deployed to the Tomcat application server located at *build/tomcat*.

. Create the application database: *Run* -> *Create database*.

. Start the application server: *Run* -> *Start application server*.

. Open the application's web-interface at `++http://localhost:8080/app++`. Log into the system with the name *`admin`* and password *`admin`*.

. To enable full text search functionality, open *Administration* -> *Application properties* in the application main menu, find and open the *`fts`* list of properties in the table. Open the *fts.enabled* property using double click and select *true* in the *Current value* field.

Once the steps above are completed, full text search functionality will be added to the application and ready to work. If you log out of the system and then log in again, a search field will appear in the top right panel of the main application window. Full text search can also be used in the link:{main_man_url}/gui_Filter.html#gui_Filter_fts[Filter] UI component.

However, search will not produce any results because the data has not been indexed yet.

To start one-off indexing of the current state of the database (i.e. the entities listed in the FTS configuration file by default), open the *Administration* -> *JMX Console*, find the `app-core.fts:type=FtsManager` JMX bean and consequently invoke `reindexAll()` first and then `processQueue()`.

After this, searching the "adm" string should give the following results:
