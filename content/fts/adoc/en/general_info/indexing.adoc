=== Indexing

If the FTS application component is added to the application, and the <<fts.adoc#fts.enabled,fts.enabled>> property is enabled, then each time when an indexable entity is being saved to the database its identifier gets added to the indexing queue – *SYS_FTS_QUEUE* table.

To have the indexing process running automatically in the background, the <<qs_indexing, scheduled task>> needs to be created and activated. Then separate asynchronous process periodically extracts identifiers of changed entities from the queue, loads entity instances and indexes them. Indexing is performed using the *Apache Lucene* library. Lucene document contains the following fields:

* Entity name and instance identifier.
* `all` – concatenation of the entity attributes being indexed, which includes only local and `FileDescriptor` type attributes. If the attribute has `FileDescriptor` type, the system will index the content of the corresponding file. Local attributes may have the following types: string, number, date, enumeration.
* `links` – concatenation of entities identifiers contained in indexed attributes having a reference type.

Indexed attributes are the attributes of the entity and related entities (if any), which are declared in the FTS descriptor.

Index is stored in the file system; by default, it is located in the `ftsindex` subfolder of the application work folder (defined by the `cuba.dataDir` property); for a standard deployment, this folder is `tomcat/work/app-core/ftsindex`. Index location can be changed using the <<fts.adoc#fts.indexDir,fts.indexDir>> property.
