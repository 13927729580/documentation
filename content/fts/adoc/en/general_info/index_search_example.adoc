=== Indexing and Searching Example

Let us consider the simple case of linked `Order` and `Customer` entities mentioned above.

In this case, if all object attributes are indexed, indexing of two related instances of `Order` and `Customer` will create two Lucene documents with approximately the following content:

[source, plain]
----
id: Order.id = "b671dbfc-c431-4586-adcc-fe8b84ca9617"
all: Order.number + Order.date + Order.amount = "001^2013-11-14^1000"
links: Customer.id = "f18e32bb-32c7-477a-980f-06e9cc4e7f40"
----

[source, plain]
----
id: Customer.id = "f18e32bb-32c7-477a-980f-06e9cc4e7f40"
all: Customer.name + Customer.email = "John Doe^john.doe@mail.com"
----

Let's assume our search string is "john":

* First, the search is performed in `all` fields of both documents. The system will find the `Customer` entity and will include it in search results.
* Then, the system will search for the identifier of the previously found customer in the `links` fields of all documents. The system will find the `Order` and will add it to search results as well.
