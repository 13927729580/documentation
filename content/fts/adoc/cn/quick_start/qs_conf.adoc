=== Setting up Configuration File

When you add  `fts` base project, the new `fts.xml` file is created with the following content
 in the source text directory of the *core* module:

[source, xml]
----
<fts-config>
    <entities>

        <entity class="com.sample.library.entity.Author">
            <include re=".*"/>
        </entity>

        <entity class="com.sample.library.entity.Book">
            <include re=".*"/>
        </entity>

        <entity class="com.sample.library.entity.BookInstance">
            <include re=".*"/>
        </entity>

        <entity class="com.sample.library.entity.BookPublication">
            <include re=".*"/>
        </entity>

        <entity class="com.sample.library.entity.LibraryDepartment">
            <include re=".*"/>
        </entity>

        <entity class="com.sample.library.entity.LiteratureType">
            <include re=".*"/>
        </entity>

        <entity class="com.sample.library.entity.Publisher">
            <include re=".*"/>
        </entity>

        <entity class="com.sample.library.entity.Town">
            <include re=".*"/>
        </entity>

    </entities>
</fts-config>
----

This is the FTS configuration file, which in our case enables indexing of all domain model entities with all their attributes.

The following property is automatically added to the *app.properties* file of the application
*core* module:

[source, properties]
----
cuba.ftsConfig = +com/sample/library/fts.xml
----

As a result, indexing will include both the entities defined in the platform's *cuba-fts.xml* and the project's *fts.xml* files.

Restart the application server. From now on, full text search should work for all entities of the application model as well as entities of the platform security subsystem: `Role`, `Group`, `User`.
