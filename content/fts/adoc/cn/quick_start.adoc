== Quick Start

This chapter describes the example of using the full text search subsystem in the Library sample application which can be downloaded by means of CUBA Studio.

We will split the task into the following stages:

. Enable search functionality for the project, configure the indexing process and verify that it works.
. Adjust the FTS configuration file to include entities from the sample Library data model.
. Use the `BookPublication` entity and the functionality of file upload described in the https://doc.cuba-platform.com/manual-latest/file_storage.html[*File Storage*] section of the https://doc.cuba-platform.com/manual-latest/index.html[*Developer's Manual*] to illustrate search function for the loaded files.
