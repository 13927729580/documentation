==== Create Dimensions

For the dimensions, we will use Products and Customers. Each product refers to some product line, that is the type of product, e.g. _Ford T_ belongs to the _Vintage Cars_ product line.

Customers belong to certain cities, they, in turn, refer to some countries, the countries are grouped into territories.

. First, create the Product transformation. Drag and drop the *Table input* node onto the worksheet and define the fields we need for the report: product `id`, `name` and `product_line_id`.

. Then create an Insert/Update node for products:

. Create the transformation for product lines:
+
.Product transformation

. Finalize the first transformation with the *Update* node:

.Update Product

. Create the Customer transformation in the same way, including City and Territory levels, and add it to the Product one:

. When the transformation is ready, wrap it in the corresponding job, using the *START* and *Success* nodes and the *Abort job* exit node in case of an error:
