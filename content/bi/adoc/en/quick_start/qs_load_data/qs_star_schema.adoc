==== Create Star Schema

Now let's assemble the dimensions and facts jobs into the complete star schema:

. Add the *START* node to start the job.

. Start the job with the *Check Db connections* condition.

. In case the DB is not connected, add the *Abort job* node for the job.

. Then add consequently *Update Dimensions* and *Update Facts* jobs that we have designed earlier.

. Finalize the job with the *Success* node and run the job:

. Save all the job and transformation files in the project folder for further use.
