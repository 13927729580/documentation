=== Loading Data to Star Schema

In our Pentaho report we will use aggregated data from multiple database tables. This data will be stored in additional tables and then loaded to the Star Schema. In our case, the Star Schema will consist of one fact table (Orders) and two dimension tables (Customer and Product), providing the ability to drill into the report hierarchy.
