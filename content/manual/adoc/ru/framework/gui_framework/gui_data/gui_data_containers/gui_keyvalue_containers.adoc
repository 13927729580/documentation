====== KeyValue Containers

TODO
////
`KeyValueContainer` and `KeyValueCollectionContainer` are designed to work with `KeyValueEntity`. This entity can contain an arbitrary number of attributes which are defined at runtime.

The KeyValue containers define the following specific methods:

* `addProperty()` - as the container can store entities with any number of attributes, you have to specify what attributes are expected by using this method. It accepts a name of the attribute and its type in the form of <<datatype,Datatype>> or a Java class. In the latter case, the class should be either an entity class or a class supported by one the datatypes.

* `setIdName()` is an optional method which allows you to define one of the attributes as an identifier attribute of the entity. It means that `KeyValueEntity` instances stored in this container will have identifiers obtained from the given attribute. Otherwise, `KeyValueEntity` instances get randomly generated UUIDs.

* `getEntityMetaClass()` returns a dynamic implementation of the `MetaClass` interface that represents the current schema of `KeyValueEntity` instances. It is defined by previous calls to `addProperty()`.
