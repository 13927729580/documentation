[[spring.xml]]
=== spring.xml

The files of this type configure the main *Spring Framework* container for each application <<app_tiers,block>>. 

The `spring.xml` file of the project is specified in the <<cuba.springContextConfig,cuba.springContextConfig>> application property.

Most of the configuration of the main container is performed using bean annotations (e.g. `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Inject` and others), therefore the only mandatory part of spring.xml in an application project is the `context:component-scan` element, which specifies the base Java package for lookup of annotated classes. For example:

[source, xml]
----
<context:component-scan base-package="com.sample.sales"/>
----

The remaining configuration depends on the block that a container is being configured for, e.g. the registration of <<jmx_beans,JMX-beans>> for the Middleware block, or <<service_import,services import>> for client blocks.
