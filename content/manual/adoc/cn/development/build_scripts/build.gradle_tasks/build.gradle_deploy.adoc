`deploy` – the task of the `CubaDeployment` type which performs <<fast_deployment,fast deployment>> of a module to Tomcat. It is declared in the *core*, *web* and *portal* modules. Parameters:

* `appName` – name of the web application that will be created from the module. In fact, it is the name of a subdirectory inside `tomcat/webapps`.

* `jarNames` – the list of JAR file names (without versions) produced as a result of building a module and intended to be placed into the `WEB-INF/lib` catalog of the web application. All other module artifacts and dependencies will be copied to `tomcat/shared/lib`.
