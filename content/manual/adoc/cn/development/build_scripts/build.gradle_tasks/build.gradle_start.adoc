[[build.gradle_start]]
===== start

`start` â€“ the task of the `CubaStartTomcat` type which starts the local Tomcat server installed by the <<build.gradle_setupTomcat,setupTomcat>> task. This task is automatically added to the project when you add the *cuba* plugin, so you don't need to declare it in `build.gradle`.
