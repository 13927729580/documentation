=== Logging

The platform uses *Logback* framework for logging.

To output to the log, use *SLF4J* API: get a logger for the current class and invoke one of its methods, for example:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/development/logging_1.java[]
----

Logs for the Middleware, Web Client and Web Portal <<app_tiers,blocks>> are configured at the application server level; in <<fast_deployment,fast deployment>> mode the server is Tomcat. Logs for the Desktop Client block are configured separately.
