Let's implement a many-to-many association using the `Airport` and the `Airline` entities as an example. An airport can handle many airlines, and an airline carrier, in turn, can provide service to many airports:

* https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-model/blob/master/modules/global/src/com/company/sample/entity/airports/Airport.java[Airport.java] - the `Airport` entity contains a many-to-many list of airlines.
+
In the Studio entity designer, set for the `airlines` attribute: *Attribute type* - `ASSOCIATION`, *Cardinality* - `MANY_TO_MANY`.
+
`Airport` will be marked as the owning side of the relationship, and Studio will ask you to create the corresponding `airports` attribute in the `Airline` entity as the inverse side of the relationship.
+
[source, java]
----
@JoinTable(name = "SAMPLE_AIRLINE_AIRPORT_LINK",
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "AIRPORT_ID"),
    inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "AIRLINE_ID"))
@ManyToMany
protected List<Airline> airlines;
----

* https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-model/blob/master/modules/global/src/com/company/sample/entity/airports/Airline.java[Airline.java] - the `Airline` entity now contains the many-to-many list of airports: *Attribute type* - `ASSOCIATION`, *Cardinality* - `MANY_TO_MANY`.
+
[source, java]
----
@JoinTable(name = "SAMPLE_AIRLINE_AIRPORT_LINK",
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "AIRLINE_ID"),
    inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "AIRPORT_ID"))
@ManyToMany
protected List<Airport> airports;
----
+
`Airline` will be also marked by default as the owning side of the relationship, which enables modification of the collections on the both sides.

* https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-model/blob/master/modules/global/src/com/company/sample/views.xml[views.xml] - the `airport-airlines` view of the airport editing screen contains the airlines association attribute with the `_minimal` view. The `airline-airports` view includes the airports association as well.

* https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-model/blob/master/modules/web/src/com/company/sample/web/airports/airport/airport-edit.xml[airport-edit.xml] - the XML descriptor of the airport editor defines a datasource for the `Airport` instance and a nested one for its airlines. It also contains a table displaying airlines and the actions https://doc.cuba-platform.com/manual-latest/list_actions.html#addAction[add] and https://doc.cuba-platform.com/manual-latest/list_actions.html#removeAction[remove].

* https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-model/blob/master/modules/web/src/com/company/sample/web/airline/airline-edit.xml[airline-edit.xml] - the XML descriptor of the airline editor defines a datasource for the `Airline` instance and a nested one for its airports. It also contains a table displaying airports and the actions *add* and *remove*.
+
So, the `Airport` and the `Airline` editors are absolutely symmetrical.

As a result, editing of an airline instance works as follows:

The airline edit screen shows a list of airports.

A user can click *Add*, the https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-model/blob/master/modules/web/src/com/company/sample/web/airports/airport/airport-browse.xml[`Airport` lookup] will be opened, and the user can either select an airport to add or open its editor. When OK is clicked in the https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-model/blob/master/modules/web/src/com/company/sample/web/airports/airport/airport-edit.xml[airport editor], the updated instance of the airport is saved both to the database and to the https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-model/blob/master/modules/web/src/com/company/sample/web/airline/airline-edit.xml#L12[`airportsDs` datasource] of the airline editor, as the `Airport` entity is fully independent.

The user can create new airports and delete existing ones, and all changes will be saved to the database in a separate transactions and to the `airportsDs` datasource.

When a user clicks OK in the airline edit screen, the updated `Airline` instance together with newly created links to the `Airport` instances is submitted to the <<dataManager,DataManager>>.commit() method on the middleware and saved to the database.

It works absolutely the same way from the other side in the `Aiport` editor.
