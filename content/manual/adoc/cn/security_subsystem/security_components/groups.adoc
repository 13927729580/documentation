==== Access Groups

With access groups, users can be organized into a hierarchical structure and assigned <<constraints,constraints>> and arbitrary <<session_attr,session attributes>>.

The user can be added to one group only, however the list of constraints and session attributes from all the groups up the hierarchy will be inherited.

User access groups can be managed from the *Administration* > *Access Groups* screen:
