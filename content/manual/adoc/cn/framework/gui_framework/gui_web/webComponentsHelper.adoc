===== Working with Vaadin Components

In order to work directly with Vaadin components that implement interfaces of the <<gui_vcl,visual components library>> in Web Client, use the following methods of the `Component` interface:

* `unwrap()` â€“ retrieves an underlying Vaadin component for a given CUBA component.

* `unwrapComposition()` - retrieves a Vaadin component that is the outmost external container in the implementation of a given CUBA component. For simple components, such as <<gui_Button,Button>>, this method returns the same object as `unwrap()` - `com.vaadin.ui.Button`. For complex components, such as <<gui_Table,Table>>, `unwrap()` will return the corresponding object - `com.vaadin.ui.Table`, while `unwrapComposition()` will return `com.vaadin.ui.VerticalLayout`, which contains the table together with <<gui_ButtonsPanel,ButtonsPanel>> and `RowsCount` defined with it.

The methods accept a class of the underlying component to be returned, for example:

[source, java]
----
com.vaadin.ui.TextField vTextField = textField.unwrap(com.vaadin.ui.TextField.class);
----

You can also use the `unwrap()` and `getComposition()` static methods of the `WebComponentsHelper` class, passing a CUBA component into them.

Please note that if a screen is located in the project's *gui* module, you can only work with generalized interfaces of CUBA components. In order to use `unwrap()` you should either put the entire screen into the *web* module, or use the <<companions,controller companions>> mechanism.
