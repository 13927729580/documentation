====== Creating a Custom Theme

You can create one or several application themes in the project and give the users an opportunity to select the most appropriate one. Creating new themes also allows you to override the variables in the `++*-theme.properties files++`, which define a few server-side parameters:

--
* Default dialog window size.

* Default input field width.

* Dimensions of some components (<<gui_Filter,Filter>>, <<gui_FileMultiUploadField,FileMultiUploadField>>).

* Correspondence between icon names and constants of the `com.vaadin.server.FontAwesome` enumeration for using *Font Awesome* in standard actions and screens of the platform, if <<cuba.web.useFontIcons,cuba.web.useFontIcons>> is enabled.

Creating a new theme::

Below is the example of creating a Halo-based Facebook theme, which resembles the interface of a popular social network.

. In CUBA Studio, open *Project Properties* section and click *Create custom theme*. Set the theme name - `facebook`, select `halo` as the base theme and click *Create*. The new theme directory will be created in the project:
+
[source, plain]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_25.scss[]
----
+
The `styles.scss` file contains the list of your themes:
+
[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_7.scss[]
----
+
The `facebook.scss` file:
+
[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_8.scss[]
----
+
The `app-component.scss` file inside `com.haulmont.cuba`:
+
[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_24.scss[]
----

. Modify the theme variables in `facebook-defaults.scss`. You can do it in Studio by clicking *Manage theme > Edit Facebook theme variables* or in IDE:
+
[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_9.scss[]
----

. The `facebook-theme.properties` file in the `src` directory of the *web* module can be used to override the server-side theme variables from the `halo-theme.properties` file of the platform.

. The new theme has been automatically added to the `web-app.properties` file:
+
[source, properties]
----
cuba.web.theme = facebook
cuba.themeConfig = havana-theme.properties halo-theme.properties /com/company/application/web/facebook-theme.properties
---- 
+
The <<cuba.themeConfig,cuba.themeConfig>> property defines which themes will be available for the user in the *Settings* menu of an application.

. Rebuild the application and start the server. Now the user will see the application in Facebook theme on first login, and will be able to choose between Facebook, Halo and Havana in the *Help* > *Settings* menu.

Modifying server-side theme parameters::
+
--
In Halo theme, *Font Awesome* icons are used for standard actions and platform screens by default (if <<cuba.web.useFontIcons,cuba.web.useFontIcons>> is enabled). In this case, you can replace a standard icon by setting the required mapping between the icon and the font element name in `<your_theme>-theme.properties` file. For example, to use "plus" icon for the `create` action in the new Facebook theme, the `facebook-theme.properties` file should contain the following:

[source, properties]
----
@include=halo-theme.properties

cuba.web.icons.create.png = font-icon:PLUS
----

The fragment of the standard users browser screen in the Facebook theme with the modified `create` action:
