===== CUBA Scheduled Tasks

*CUBA* scheduled tasks mechanism is intended to perform scheduled execution of arbitrary Spring beans methods on Middleware. The purposes of this mechanism and its distinction from the above mentioned standard *Spring Framework* schedulers are:

* The ability to configure tasks while running an application without restarting the server.

* The coordination of singleton tasks in the Middleware cluster, including: 

** Reliable protection from simultaneous execution.

** Binding tasks to servers by priorities.

A _singleton_ task is a task which must be executed only on one server at a certain moment of time. For example, reading from a queue and sending emails.
