===== FileLoader Interface

The `FileLoader` interface allows you to work with file storage using the same set of methods on both middle and client tiers. Uploading and downloading of files is performed using streams:

* `saveStream()` – saves an `InputStream` contents into file storage.

* `openStream()` – returns an input stream to load a file contents from file storage.

[TIP]
====
Both client-side and server-side implementations of `FileLoader` follow the common rule: file transfer is always performed by copying data between input and output streams. Files are never fully loaded into memory at any application level, which enables transferring files of almost any size.
====

As an example of using `FileLoader` let's consider a simple task of saving a user input into the text file and displaying the file content in another field on the same screen.

The screen contains two `textArea` fields. Suppose the user inputs text in the first `textArea`, clicks the `buttonIn` below, and the text is saved to the `FileStorage`. The second `textArea` will display the content of the saved file on `buttonOut` click.

Below is the fragment of the screen XML descriptor:

The screen controller contains two methods invoked on buttons click:

* In the `onButtonInClick()` method we create a byte array from the first `textArea` input. Then we create a `FileDescriptor` object and define the new file name, extension, size, and creation date with its attributes.
+
Then we save the new file with the `saveStream()` method of `FileLoader`, passing the `FileDescriptor` to it and providing the file content with an `InputStream` supplier. We also commit the `FileDescriptor` to the data store using the `DataManager` interface.

* In the `onButtonOutClick()` method we extract the content of the saved file using the `openStream()` method of the `FileLoader`. Then we display the content of the file in the second `textArea`.
