[[entity_snapshots]]
==== Entity Snapshots

The entity saving mechanism, much like the <<entity_log,entity log>>, is intended to track data changes at runtime. It has the following distinct features:

* The whole state (or snapshot) of a graph of entities defined by a specified <<views,view>> is saved.

* Snapshot saving mechanism is explicitly called from the application code.

* The platform allows the snapshots to be viewed and compared.
