[[soft_deletion_unique_constr]]
====== Unique Constraints at Database Level

In order to apply unique constraints for certain value in the soft deletion mode, at least one non-deleted record with this value and an arbitrary number of deleted records with the same value may exist in database.

This logic can be implemented in a specific way for each database server type:

* If database server supports partial indexes (e.g. *PostgreSQL*), unique restrictions can be achieved as follows:
+
[source, sql]
----
create unique index IDX_SEC_USER_UNIQ_LOGIN on SEC_USER (LOGIN_LC) where DELETE_TS is null
----

* If database server does not support partial indexes (e.g. *Microsoft SQL Server 2005*), *DELETE_TS* field can be included in the unique index:
+
[source, sql]
----
create unique index IDX_SEC_USER_UNIQ_LOGIN on SEC_USER (LOGIN_LC, DELETE_TS)
----
