==== Application Structure

The above-listed architectural principles are directly reflected in the composition of assembled application. Let us consider the example of a simple application *sales*, which has two blocks – *Middleware* and *Web Client*; and includes the functionality of the two application components - *cuba* and *reports*.

The figure demonstrates the contents of several directories of the *Tomcat* server with a deployed application *sales* in it.

The *Middleware* <<app_tiers,block>> is represented by the `app-core` web application, the *Web Client* block – by the `app` web application. The executable code of the web applications can be found in directories `WEB-INF/lib` in sets of JAR files. Each JAR (<<artifact, artifact>>) is a result of assembly of one of the application or a <<app_components,component>> <<app_modules,modules>>.

For instance, the contents of JAR files of the web application in middle tier `app-core` is determined by the facts that the *Middleware* block includes *global* and *core* modules, and the application uses *cuba* and *reports* components.
