===== Entity States

New:: 
+
--
An instance which has just been created in memory: `Car car = new Car()`.

A new instance may be passed to `EntityManager.persist()` to be stored to the database, in which case it changes its state to Managed.
--

Managed:: 
+
--
An instance loaded from the database, or a new one passed to `EntityManager.persist()`. Belongs to a `EntityManager` instance, i.e. is contained in its persistence context.

Any changes of the instance in Managed state will be saved to the database when the transaction that the `EntityManager` belongs to is committed.
--

Detached:: 
+
--
An instance loaded from the database and detached from its persistence context (as a result of the transaction end or serialization).

The changes applied to a Detached instance will be saved to the database only if this instance becomes Managed by being passed to `EntityManager.merge()`.
