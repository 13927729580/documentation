[[chapter_setup]]
== Installation and Setup

Minimum software requirements are as follows:

* *Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 7 or 8*. It is recommended that you use *Oracle Java HotSpot VM*. 
+
In order to build and run projects outside Studio, you need to set the path to the JDK root directory in the `++JAVA_HOME++` environment variable, e.g. `++C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_45++`. On Windows, you can do this at *Computer* -> *Properties* -> *Advanced System Settings* -> *Advanced* -> *Environment variables.* The value of the variable should be added to the *System variables* list.

* Java IDE: *IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 12+* or *Eclipse 4.3+*. We recommended using *IntelliJ IDEA*.

In the most basic scenario, the built-in *HyperSQL* (link:$$http://hsqldb.org$$[http://hsqldb.org]) can be used as the database server. This is sufficient for exploring the platform capabilities and application prototyping. For building production applications, it is recommended to install and use one of the full-featured DBMS <<dbms_types,supported by the platform>>, like *PostgreSQL* for instance.

The web interface of the platform-based applications supports all popular browsers, including *Google Chrome*, *Mozilla Firefox*, *Safari*, *Opera 15+*, *Internet Explorer 8+*.

[[cubaStudio_install]]
=== CUBA Studio Installation

Prerequisites:

* Make sure that Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 7 or 8 is installed by running the following command in the console:
+
 `java -version`
+
The command should return the Java version, e.g. `++1.8.0_45++`.

* If you connect to the internet via a proxy server, some Java system properties must be passed to the JVM running Studio and Gradle. These properties are explained here: link:$$http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html$$[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html] (see properties for HTTP and HTTPS protocols).
+
It is recommended to set these properties system-wide in the `++JAVA_OPTS++` environment variable. The Studio launch script passes `++JAVA_OPTS++` to the Java executable.

In order to install CUBA Studio, take the following steps:

. Download `studio-<version>.zip` archive at link:$$https://www.cuba-platform.com/download$$[www.cuba-platform.com/download].

. Extract the files to local directory, e.g. `c:/work/studio`

. Open the command line, go to `bin` directory and run
+
  `studio`

. In the *CUBA Studio Server* window, enter the following parameters:
+
--
* *Java home* − JDK installation to be used for building and running projects. If you have set the `++JAVA_HOME++` environment variable as described in the <<chapter_setup,beginning>> of this chapter, it will appear in this field. Otherwise, Studio will try to find your Java installation itself.

* *Gradle home* − leave this field empty; in this case, the required *Gradle* distribution will be downloaded automatically.
+
If you want to use a local Gradle distribution, enter the path to the respective directory in the field. For project build system to work correctly, Gradle is required.

* *Server port* − CUBA Studio server port (the default port is 8111).

* *IDE port* − IDE plugin listening port (the default port is 48561).

* *Repository* − binary artifacts <<artifact_repository,repository>> URL and authentication parameters.
+

The following options are also available:

* *Check for updates* - check for new versions on every start.

* *Help language* - built-in help language.

* *Offline* - enable working with projects without an Internet connection, provided that all the required libraries have been previously downloaded from the repository.

* *Send anonymous statistics and crash reports* - enable Studio to send error statistics to developers.

* *Enable remote connection* - by default, it is assumed that Studio runs on localhost. Check this box if you need to connect to this Studio copy from a remote host.
--

. Click *Start* to run the Studio server.
+
The server will download, run, and connect to the Gradle daemon. This may take a significant amount of time on first startup; on subsequent launches, this will take a few seconds.
+
After that, the web server will be started, and the URL of the Studio interface will appear in the *URL* field. By clicking *->*, you can open the address in browser; by clicking *Copy* you can copy the address to clipboard.

. Open the specified address in web browser.

. Click *Open project* in the Studio web interface. In the *Select project* window, click *New* to create a new project, or *Import* to add an existing one to the Studio list.

. Once the project is opened, the Studio will download the source code of the platform base projects and save it to the local folder. Before building the project, it is recommended to wait until the download is finished and make sure that the background task indicator in the bottom right corner of the Studio has faded out.

[[ide_integration]]
=== IDE Integration

Take the following steps to integrate Studio with *IntelliJ IDEA* or *Eclipse*:

. Open or <<qs_create_project,create a new>> project in the Studio.

. Switch to *Project properties* section and click *Edit*. Select the required *Java IDE* by checking * IntelliJ IDEA* or *Eclipse*.

. Select *Build* > *Create or update <IDE> project files* in the Studio menu. The corresponding files will be created in the project directory.

. For IntelliJ IDEA 12+ integration:

.. Run IntelliJ IDEA 12+ and install *CUBA Framework Integration* plugin, from the plugin repository: *File > Settings > Plugins > Browse Repositories*.

.. Find *CUBA* in the *Languages and Frameworks* section of the *Settings* menu. Check *Enabled* on the *Studio integration* panel and click *OK*.

. For Eclipse 4.3 integration:

.. Run Eclipse, open *Help > Install New Software*, add `++http://files.cuba-platform.com/eclipse-update-site++` repository and install the *CUBA Plugin*.

.. In the *CUBA* section of the *Window > Preferences* menu, check *Studio Integration Enabled*, and click *OK*.

Please note that *IDE: on port 48561* label has appeared in the bottom left corner of the Studio. Now the corresponding source code files will be opened in IDE when you click *IDE* buttons in the Studio.
