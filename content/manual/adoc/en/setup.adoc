[[setup]]
== Installation and Setup

Minimum software requirements are as follows:

* *Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 8*. It is recommended that you use *Oracle Java HotSpot VM*. 
+
In order to build and run projects outside Studio, you need to set the path to the JDK root directory in the `++JAVA_HOME++` environment variable, e.g. `++C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_60++`. On Windows, you can do this at *Computer* -> *Properties* -> *Advanced System Settings* -> *Advanced* -> *Environment variables.* The value of the variable should be added to the *System variables* list.

* Java IDE: *IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 13+* or *Eclipse 4.3+*. We recommend using *IntelliJ IDEA*.

In the most basic scenario, the built-in *HyperSQL* (link:$$http://hsqldb.org$$[http://hsqldb.org]) can be used as the database server. This is sufficient for exploring the platform capabilities and application prototyping. For building production applications, it is recommended to install and use one of the full-featured DBMS <<dbms_types,supported by the platform>>, like *PostgreSQL* for instance.

The web interface of the platform-based applications supports all popular browsers, including *Google Chrome*, *Mozilla Firefox*, *Safari*, *Opera 15+*, *Internet Explorer 9+*, *Microsoft Edge*.

[[cubaStudio_install]]
=== CUBA Studio Installation

Prerequisites:

* Make sure that Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 8 is installed by running the following command in the console:
+
`java -version`
+
The command should return the Java version, e.g. `++1.8.0_60++`.

* If you connect to the internet via a proxy server, some Java system properties must be passed to the JVM running Studio and Gradle. These properties are explained here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html (see properties for HTTP and HTTPS protocols).
+
It is recommended to set these properties system-wide in the `++JAVA_OPTS++` environment variable. The Studio launch script passes `++JAVA_OPTS++` to the Java executable.

In order to install CUBA Studio, take the following steps:

. Download an appropriate installer or ZIP archive from https://www.cuba-platform.com/download.

. Run the installer or unzip the archive to a local directory, e.g. `c:/work/studio`

. Launch the installed application or open the command line, go to `bin` directory and run `studio`

. In the *CUBA Studio Server* window, enter the following parameters:
+
--
* *Java home* − JDK installation to be used for building and running projects. If you have set the `++JAVA_HOME++` environment variable as described in the <<setup,beginning>> of this chapter, it will appear in this field. Otherwise, Studio will try to find your Java installation itself.

* *Advanced* button opens a dialog that allows you to enter a path to Gradle home directory. Leave it empty; in this case, the required Gradle distribution will be downloaded automatically.
+
If you want to use a local Gradle distribution, enter the path to the respective directory. For project build system to work correctly, *Gradle {gradleVersion}* is required.

* *Server port* − CUBA Studio server port (the default port is 8111).

* *IDE port* − IDE plugin listening port (the default port is 48561).

* *Repository* − binary artifacts <<artifact_repository,repository>> URL and authentication parameters.
+

The following options are also available:

* *Check for updates* - check for new versions on every start.

* *Help language* - built-in help language.

* *Offline* - enable working with projects without an Internet connection, provided that all the required libraries have been previously downloaded from the repository.

* *Send anonymous statistics and crash reports* - enable Studio to send error statistics to developers.

* *Enable remote connection* - by default, it is assumed that Studio runs on localhost. Select this checkbox if you need to connect to this Studio instance from a remote host.

* *Silent startup* - if selected, the Studio server starts in tray and opens UI in default browser automatically. This option is available only for Windows and Mac OS X.

. Click *Start* to run the Studio server.
+
The server will download, run, and connect to the Gradle daemon. This may take a significant amount of time on first startup; on subsequent launches, this will take just a few seconds.
+
After that, the web server will be started, and the URL of the Studio interface will appear in the *URL* field. By clicking *->*, you can open the address in your default web browser; by clicking *Copy* you can copy the address to the clipboard.

. Open the specified address in the web browser.

. In the Studio web interface, click *Create new* to create a new project, or *Import* to add an existing one to the *Recent* list.

. Once the project is opened, the Studio will download the source code of the platform base projects and save it to the local folder. Before building the project, it is recommended to wait until the download is finished and make sure that the background task indicator in the bottom left corner has faded out.

[[ide_integration]]
=== IDE Integration

Take the following steps to integrate Studio with *IntelliJ IDEA* or *Eclipse*:

. Open or <<qs_create_project,create a new>> project in the Studio.

. Switch to *Project properties* section and click *Edit*. Select the required *Java IDE* by checking *IntelliJ IDEA* or *Eclipse*.

. Select *Build* > *Create or update <IDE> project files* in the Studio menu. The corresponding files will be created in the project directory.

. For IntelliJ IDEA integration:

.. Run IntelliJ IDEA 13+ and install *CUBA Framework Integration* plugin, from the plugin repository: *File > Settings > Plugins > Browse Repositories*.

. For Eclipse integration:

.. Run Eclipse 4.3+, open *Help > Install New Software*, add `++http://files.cuba-platform.com/eclipse-update-site++` repository and install the *CUBA Plugin*.

.. In the *CUBA* section of the *Window > Preferences* menu, check *Studio Integration Enabled*, and click *OK*.

Please note that *IDE: on port 48561* label has appeared in the bottom left corner of the Studio. Now the corresponding source code files will be opened in IDE when you click *IDE* buttons in the Studio.
