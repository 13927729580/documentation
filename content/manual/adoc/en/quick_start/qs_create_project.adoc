=== Creating a Project

. Start CUBA Studio and open its web interface (See <<cubaStudio_install>>).

. Click *Create new*.

. Specify the name of the new project in the *Project name* field of the *New project* window – for example, `sales`. The name should contain only Latin letters, numbers and underscores. Think carefully on the project name at this stage, as changing it later on will require complex manual intervention.

. The following fields below will be automatically populated: 
+
* *Project path* – the path to the new project directory. You can select the directory manually by clicking the *...* button next to the field. The *Select folder* window will appear with the list of folders n your hard drive. You can select one of those, or create a new directory by clicking the *+* button.

* *Project namespace* – the namespace which will be used as a prefix for entity names and database tables. The namespace can consist of Latin letters only and should be as short as possible. For example, if the project name is `++sales_2++`, the namespace can be `sales` or `sal`.

* *Root package* − the root package of Java classes. It can be adjusted later, but the classes generated at project creation will not be moved.

* *Repository* − binary artifacts <<artifact_repository,repository>> URL and authentication parameters.

* *Platform version* – the platform version used in the project. The platform artifacts will be automatically downloaded from the repository on project build.

. Click *OK*. Empty project will be created in the specified `sales` directory and the main Studio window will open.

. Assemble the project: select option *Build* > *Assemble project* in the Studio main menu. At this stage all required libraries will be downloaded and project <<artifact,artifacts>> will be assembled in `build` subdirectories of the modules.

. Create the database on the local *HyperSQL* server: select option *Run* > *Create database* in the menu. The database name is the same as project namespace by default.

. Select *Run* > *Deploy* menu option. *Tomcat* server with the deployed application will be installed in the project `deploy` subdirectory.

. Select *Run* > *Start application server* option. The link next to the *Web application* caption on the status panel will become available in a few seconds so you will be able to open the application directly from Studio.
+
The username and password are `admin` / `admin`.
+
The running application contains two main menu items (*Administration* and *Help*), as well as security and administration subsystems functionality.
