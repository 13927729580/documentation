==== Application Menu

At the moment of their creation, the screens were added to the *application* menu item of the default application menu. Let's rename it. Switch to the *Generic UI* tab on the navigation panel and click *Open web menu*. The *Menu Designer* page will open. Select the `application-sales` menu item to edit its properties.

Enter the new value of the menu identifier − `shop` − in the *Id* field, then click *OK* on the top panel.
