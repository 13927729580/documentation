[[qs_create_order_screens]]
==== Order Screens

`Order` entity has the following distinction: since one of the attributes is the `Order.customer` reference attribute, you should define a <<views,view>> including this attribute (standard `++_local++` view does not include reference attributes).

Go to the *Data Model* tab on the navigation panel, select the `Order` entity and click the *New* > *View* button. View designer page will open. Enter `order-with-customer` as the view name, click on `customer` attribute and select `++_minimal++` view for the `Customer` entity on the panel on the right.

After that, select the `Order` entity and click *New* > *Generic UI screen*.

Select `order-with-customer` in the *View* fields for both browser and editor templates and click *Create*.
