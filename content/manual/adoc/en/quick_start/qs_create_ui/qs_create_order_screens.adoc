==== Order Screens

The `Order` entity has the following distinction: since one of the attributes is the `Order.customer` reference attribute, you should define a <<views,view>> including this attribute (standard `++_local++` view does not include reference attributes).

Go to the *Data Model* section of CUBA project tree, right-click on the `Order` entity and in its context menu select *New* > *View*. View designer page will open. Enter `order-with-customer` as the view name, click on `customer` attribute and select the `++_minimal++` view for the `Customer` entity on the panel on the right.

Click *OK*.

After that, select the `Order` entity and in its context menu select *New* > *Screen*.

Select *Entity browser and editor screens* template.

Select `order-with-customer` as the view for both browser and editor screens and click *Next* and then *Finish* on the next screen.

The screen files will appear in the *Screens* section of the *Generic UI* tree section:

* `order-browse.xml` - browser screen descriptor,
* `OrderBrowse` - browser screen controller,
* `order-edit.xml` - editor screen descriptor,
* `OrderEdit` - editor screen controller.
