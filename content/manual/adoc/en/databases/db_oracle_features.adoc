Due to the distribution policy of Oracle JDBC driver, it can only be downloaded manually from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/index-091264.html.

After downloading, copy the `ojdbc6.jar` file to the `lib` subdirectory of the CUBA Studio installation path and to the `lib` subdirectory of the installed Tomcat server. Then stop Studio, stop Gradle daemon by executing

[source, plain]
----
gradle --stop

in the command line, then start Studio again.

For SE version, copy the JAR file to the `~/.haulmont/studio/lib/` directory and to the `lib` subdirectory of the installed Tomcat server.
