==== Metadata Framework

Metadata framework is used to support efficient work with <<data_model,data model>> in CUBA-applications. The framework:

* provides API for obtaining information about <<entity, entities>>, their attributes and relations between the entities; it is also used for traversing object graphs;

* serves as a specialized and more convenient alternative for Java Reflection API;

* controls permitted data types and relationships between entities;

* enables implementation of universal mechanisms for operations with data.
