==== Managed Beans

_Managed Beans_ are program components intended for implementation of the application's business logic. "Managed" in this case means that the instance creation and dependency management is handled by the <<container, container>>, which is the main part of the *Spring* framework.

[TIP]
====
Managed Bean is a _singleton_ by default, i.e., only one instance of such class exists in each application block. If a singleton bean contains mutable data in fields (in other words, has a state), it is necessary to synchronize access to such data.
