===== Enum Localization

To localize the enumeration names and values, add messages with the following keys to the message pack located in the Java package of the enumeration class:

* Enumeration name key – simple class name (without package);
* Value key – simple class name, then the value name separated by period.

For example, for enum

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/common/enumlocale_1.java[]
----

default English localization file `/com/abc/sales/messages.properties` should contain the following lines:

[source, properties]
----
CustomerGrade=Customer Grade
CustomerGrade.PREMIUM=Premium
CustomerGrade.HIGH=High
CustomerGrade.STANDARD=Standard
----

Localized enum values are automatically used by different visual components such as <<gui_LookupField,LookupField>>. You can obtain localized enum value programmatically: use `getMessage()` method of the <<messages,Messages>> interface and simply pass the `enum` instance to it.
