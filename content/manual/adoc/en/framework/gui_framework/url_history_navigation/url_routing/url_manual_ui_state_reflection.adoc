====== Manual UI State Reflection

To change URL according to currently opened screen special object exists that implements `UrlRouting` interface. It has three main methods:

* `void pushState(Screen screen)` – changes an address and pushes new browser history entry;
* `void replaceState(Screen screen)` – replaces an address without adding new browser history entry;
* `NavigationState getState()` – returns a current state.

`UrlRouting` can be injected as any other component, for example, `Notifications`.
