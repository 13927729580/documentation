[[url_qs_reflection_state_to_URL]]
====== Reflection state to URL

For example, the `TaskStatistic` screen has a group of controls that allows you to switch task statistics. To reflect the currently viewed task to URL, you should use the <<url_manual_ui_state_reflection,`UrlRouting`>> component.

The following code example contains three simple steps to reflect the currently viewed task to URL:

* get the current task from the `LookupField`;
* serialize its id with the `UrlTools` helper;
* replace the current state with the new containing serialized task id as a parameter.
