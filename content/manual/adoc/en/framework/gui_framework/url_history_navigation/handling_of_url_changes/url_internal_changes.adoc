[[url_internal_changes]]
====== Internal Changes

All opened screens reflect their routes on URL, for example, the user browser screen has the following address:
[source, url]
----
http://localhost:8080/app/#main/0/users
----

If a screen doesn't have registered route only state mark will be passed to URL.

Edited entity id is added to address as a parameter if an editor has a registered route. In the case of user editor URL can be:

[source, url]
----
http://localhost:8080/app/#main/1/users/edit?id=27zy3tj6f47p2e3m4w58vdca9y
----

UUID ids are encoded as Base64 strings, all other id types are used as-is.
