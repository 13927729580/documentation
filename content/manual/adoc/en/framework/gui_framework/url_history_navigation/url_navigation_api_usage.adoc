===== Using URL History and Navigation API

This section contains examples of using the URL History and Navigation API.

Suppose we have a `Task` entity and `TaskInfo` screen with an information about a selected task.

The `TaskInfo` screen controller contains the `@Route` annotation to specify the route to the screen:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/url_taskStatistic_screen.java[]
----

As a result, a user can open the screen by entering `++http://localhost:8080/app/#main/task-info++` in the address bar:

When the screen is open, the address contains also a state mark.

Mapping State to URL::

Suppose that the `TaskInfo` screen shows information about a single task at a time, and it has controls to switch the selected tasks. You may want to reflect the currently viewed task in the URL to be able to copy the URL and later open the screen for this particular task just by pasting the URL to the address bar.

The following code implements mapping of the selected task to the URL:


[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/url_mapStateToUrl.java[]
----

<1> - get the current task from `LookupField`
<2> - remove URL parameters if no task is selected
<3> - serialize task's id with the `UrlIdSerializer` helper
<4> - replace the current URL state with the new one containing serialized task id as a parameter.

As a result, the application URL is changed when the user selects a task and clicks the *Select Task* button:

Now let's implement the last requirement: when a user enters the URL with the route and the `task_id` parameter, the application must show the screen with the corresponding task selected. Below is the complete screen controller code.

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/url_paramsChangedEvent_listener.java[]
----

<1> - get the parameter value from `UrlParamsChangedEvent`
<2> - deserialize the task id
<3> - load the task instance and set it to the field
