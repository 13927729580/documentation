===== Using URL History and Navigation API

This section contains the sample that demonstrates how new features can be used:

* <<url_routes_registration,Registering a route>> for <<screen_controller,screen controller>>;
* <<url_navigation_filter,NavigationFilter>> mechanism usage example;
* <<url_manual_ui_state_reflection,Manual reflection current UI state to URL>>;
* <<urlParamsChangedEvent,UrlParamsChangedEvent>> firing and handling.

The sample project has `Task` entity (some work execution) and `TaskStatistic` screen, that is available only for users with `Manager` role.

All generic actions (data model and generic screens creation) are skipped.
