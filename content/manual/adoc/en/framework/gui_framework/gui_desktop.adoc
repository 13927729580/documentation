==== Desktop Client Specifics

Implementation of the generic user interface in the *Desktop Client* <<app_tiers,block>> is based on *Java Swing*. The main classes available in the desktop client infrastructure are described below.

.Classes of the Desktop Client Infrastructure

* `App` – central class of the desktop application infrastructure. Contains links to `Connection` and main `TopLevelFrame`, as well as methods for initialization and retrieval of application settings.
+
In your application, you should create a custom class – inheritor of `App` and override the following methods:

** `getDefaultAppPropertiesConfig()` - should return a string where all <<app_properties_files,application properties files>> should be listed separated by spaces: 
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/desktopclient_1.java[]
---- 

** `getDefaultHomeDir()` - should return path to the folder, where temporary and work files should be stored. For example: 
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/desktopclient_2.java[]
---- 

** `getDefaultLogConfig()` - should return name of the *Logback* configuration file, if it is defined for the project. For example:
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/desktopclient_3.java[]
---- 
+
Additionally, for your custom class inheriting from the `App` you should define `main()` method in the following way: 
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/desktopclient_4.java[]
---- 

* `Connection` - is a class that provides the functionality of connecting to middleware and storing a <<userSession,user session>>. 

* `LoginDialog` – the dialog to enter credentials. In your application you can create an inheritor of `LoginDialog` and redefine the `createLoginDialog()` method of the `App` class to use it.

* `TopLevelFrame` – inheritor of `JFrame`, which is the top level window. The application has at least one instance of this class created when application is started and containing the main menu. This instance is returned by the `getMainFrame()` method of the `App` class.
+
When a user detaches tabs from the main window or a <<gui_TabSheet,TabSheet>> (see `detachable` attribute), additional instances of `TopLevelFrame` that do not contain main menu are created.

* `WindowManager` - the central class implementing application screens management logic. `openEditor()`, `showMessageDialog()` and other methods of the `Frame` interface implemented by screen <<screen_controller,controllers>> delegate to the window manager. `WindowManager` class is located in the platform's common *gui* module and is abstract. The *desktop* desktop module has a dedicated `DesktopWindowManager` class that implements desktop client specifics.
+
Typically, `WindowManager` is not used in the application code directly.

* `ExceptionHandlers` - contains a collection of <<exceptionHandlers,client-level exception handlers>>.
