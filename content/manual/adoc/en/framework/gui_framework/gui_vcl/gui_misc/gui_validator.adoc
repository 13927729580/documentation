====== Validator

Validator is designed to check values entered into visual components.

[WARNING]
====
Validation and input type checking should be differentiated. If a given component (e.g. <<gui_TextField,TextField>>) data type is set to anything different than string (this can happen when binding to an entity attribute or setting `datatype`), then the component will not allow the user to enter a value that does not comply with this data type.  When the component loses focus or when the user presses Enter, the component will show the previous correct value.

On the other hand, validation does not act immediately on data entry or focus loss, but rather when the component's `validate()` method is invoked. It means that the component (and the entity attribute that it is linked to) may temporarily contain a value, which does not comply with the conditions of validation. It should not be a problem because the validated fields are typically located in <<screen_edit,edit screens>>, which automatically invoke validation for all their fields before commit. If the component is located not in an edit screen, its `validate()` method should be invoked explicitly in the screen controller.
====

In a screen XML-descriptor, a component validator can be defined in a nested `validator` elements. The `validator` element can have the following attributes:

* `script` − path to a Groovy script performing validation.

* `class` − name of a Java class implementing the `Field.Validator` interface.

Groovy validator scripts and standard classes of Java validators, located in the `com.haulmont.cuba.gui.components.validators` package support `message` attribute − a message displayed to a user when validation fails. The attribute value should contain either a message or a message key from the <<message_packs,messages pack>> of the current screen. For example:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/validator_1.xml[]
----

[source, properties]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/validator_1.properties[]
---- 

Validator can be added using CUBA Studio interface. Below is an example of adding a validator to the `fieldGroup` field:

The validation mechanism is selected as follows:

* If the value of the `script` attribute is not set and the `validator` element itself does not contain text with a Groovy expression, then the system will use a class defined in the `class` attribute as a validator.
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/validator_6.xml[]
----

* If the `validator` element contains text, it will be used as a Groovy expression and executed using <<scripting,Scripting>>.
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/validator_5.xml[]
----

* Otherwise, the system will use <<scripting,Scripting>> to run a Groovy script defined in the `script` attribute.
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/validator_7.xml[]
----

The `value` variable will be passed to a Groovy expression or script. It contains the value entered into a visual component. The expression or the script should return a `boolean` value: `true` − valid, `false` − not valid.

If a Java class is being used as a validator, it should have a default constructor without parameters or a constructor with the following set of parameters: 

* `org.dom4j.Element`, `String` – this constructor will receive the validator XML-element and the message pack name of the screen.

* `org.dom4j.Element` – this constructor will receive the validator XML-element.

[TIP]
====
If the validator is implemented as an internal class, it should be declared with a `static` modifier and its name should be separated by "$", for example:

`<validator class="com.sample.sales.gui.AddressEdit$ZipValidator"/>`
====

The platform contains the set of implementations for the most frequently used validators (see `com.haulmont.cuba.gui.components.validators` package), which can be used in your project:

* `DateValidator`

* `DoubleValidator`

* `EmailValidator`

* `IntegerValidator`

* `LongValidator`

* `PatternValidator`

* `ScriptValidator`

* `StringValidator`

A validator class can be assigned to a component not only using a screen XML-descriptor, but also programmatically – by submitting a validator instance into the component's `addValidator()` method.

Example of creating a validator class for zip codes:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/validator_2.java[]
---- 

Example of using a zip code validator and a standard pattern validator for fields of a <<gui_FieldGroup,FieldGroup>> component:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/validator_3.xml[]
---- 

Example of setting a validator programmatically in a screen controller: 

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/validator_4.java[]
----
