[[gui_icons]]
==== Icons

Image files used in the <<gui_attr_icon,icon>> properties for <<gui_Action,actions>> and visual components, e.g. <<gui_Button,Button>>, can be added to your theme extension.

For example, to add an icon to the Halo theme extension, you have to add the image file to the `modules/web/themes/halo` directory described in the <<web_theme_extension>> section (it is recommended to create a subfolder):

[source, plain]
----
themes/
  halo/
    icons/
      cool-icon.png
----

In the following sections, we consider using the icons in visual components and adding icons from arbitrary font libraries.
