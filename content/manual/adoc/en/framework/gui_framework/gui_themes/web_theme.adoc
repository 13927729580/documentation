===== Themes in Web Applications

A web theme consists of link:http://sass-lang.com[SCSS] files and other resources like images.

The platform provides several themes that can be used in the project <<web_theme_usage,out-of-the-box>>. A <<web_theme_extension,theme extension>> allows you to modify an existing theme on the project level. You can also create your own <<web_theme_creation,custom themes>> in addition to the standard ones.

If you want to use a theme in multiple projects, you can <<web_theme_inheritance,include it in an application component>> or create a reusable <<web_theme_reusable,theme JAR>>.
