===== Themes in Desktop Applications

The base theme for desktop applications is `Nimbus`.

To add any changes to the standard theme, you need to create a `res.nimbus` package in the `com.sample.sales.desktop` package of the *desktop* module. Theme files will be stored in the `res.nimbus` package.

The `icons` folder contains icon files, the `nimbus.xml` file contains the description of the theme style.

The <<app_properties,properties file>> of a desktop application should have `cuba.desktop.resourceLocations` property defined (defines a set of folders containing the style files): 

[source, properties]
----
cuba.desktop.resourceLocations = \
com/haulmont/cuba/desktop/res \
com/sample/sales/desktop/res
----

Below are examples of common tasks.

Adding an icon::
+
--
If you need to add a new icon to a desktop application, for example an icon for a button, you should create a `res.nimbus.icons` package within the `com.sample.sales.desktop` package of the *desktop* module and put the corresponding icon there.

Description of a <<gui_Button,button>> in the <<screen_xml_glossentry,descriptor>> with a path to an icon set in the <<gui_attr_icon,icon>> attribute:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_10.xml[]
----

Below you can see a button with the attention.png icon.

--

Redefining default values of theme properties::
+
--
For example, let us change text field background color for mandatory fields.

The `nimbus.xml` file with the following content should be created in the `res.nimbus` package:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_11.xml[]
---- 

The `ui-defaults` element redefines the values of platform theme properties set by default.

The `ui-defaults` element includes both the properties contained in a standard `Nimbus` (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/lookandfeel/_nimbusDefaults.html) theme and the properties created in the CUBA platform.

In this example, we redefined the value of the CUBA property â€“ `cubaRequiredBackground`, which stores the background color for required fields. This change will affect all required input fields.
--

Creating a style for an element using standard tools::
+
--
Let's consider an example of highlighting a text in bold.

To create a style like that you need to define `style` element in the theme file `nimbus.xml` in the following way:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_12.xml[]
---- 

`style` element can also contain other elements which can define different properties: `background`, `foreground`, `icon`.

You should add <<gui_attr_stylename,stylename>> attribute with the name of the created style into the description of the corresponding label in an <<screen_xml_glossentry,xml-descriptor>>.

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_13.xml[]
---- 

In such way the style will be applied only to the labels that have <<gui_attr_stylename,stylename>> attribute with the value of `boldlabel`.
--

Creating a custom style::
+
--
If standard style adjustment capabilities are insufficient, you can create a custom style.

Let us create a custom style that will be applied to the <<gui_Button,Button>> component. With this style, the the button caption will be underlined.

First, create a decorator class `UnderlinedLabelDecorator`:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_14.java[]
---- 

Define a custom style in `nimbus.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_15.xml[]
---- 

The `component` attribute of the `style` element contains the name of the component that the style with the name `button-underlined` can be applied to.

The `custom` element should contain a path to the decorator class defined above.

When creating an XML element for a button that should have the custom style, specify the style name in the `stylename` attribute:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_16.xml[]
---- 

The button with the custom style:
