====== Using Existing Themes

The platform includes three ready-to-use themes: Hover, Halo and Havana. By default, the application will use the one specified in the <<cuba.web.theme,cuba.web.theme>> application property.

The user may select the other theme in the standard *Help* > *Settings* screen. If you want to disable the option of selecting themes, register the `settings` screen in the <<screens.xml,web-screens.xml>> file of your project and set the `changeThemeEnabled = false` parameter for it:
