===== Standard Actions

This section will be updated before release 7.0

Standard <<gui_Action,actions>> are classes that implement the `Action` interface and are intended to solve common tasks, such as invocation of an edit screen for an entity selected in a table. Standard actions have strictly defined identifiers; therefore, for the declaration of a standard action in XML, it is enough to specify its identifier.

There are two types of standard actions:

* <<std_list_actions,Actions over collections>> of entities that are displayed in tables or trees.

* <<std_picker_actions,Picker field actions>>.
