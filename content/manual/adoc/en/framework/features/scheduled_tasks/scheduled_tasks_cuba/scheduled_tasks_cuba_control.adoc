====== Tasks Handling Control

* <<cuba.schedulingActive,cuba.schedulingActive>> application property should be set to `true` to enable tasks processing. You can do it either in the *Administration > Application Properties* screen, or through the `app-core.cuba:type=Scheduling` JMX bean (see its `Active` attribute).

* All changes to tasks made via system screens take effect immediately for all servers in the cluster.

* The `removeExecutionHistory()` method of the `app-core.cuba:type=Scheduling` JMX bean can be used to remove old execution history. The method has two parameters:

** `age` – the time (in hours) elapsed after the task execution.

** `maxPeriod` – the maximum `Period` (in hours) for tasks that should have their execution history removed. This enables removing the history for frequently run tasks only, while keeping the history for tasks executed once a day.
+
The method can be invoked automatically. Create a new task with the following parameters:

*** *Bean name* – `++cuba_SchedulingMBean++`

*** *Method name* – `removeExecutionHistory(String age, String maxPeriod)`

*** *Method parameters* – for example, `age` = 72, `maxPeriod` = 12.
