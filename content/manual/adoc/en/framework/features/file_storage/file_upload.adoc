[[file_upload]]
===== Uploading Files

Files from the user's computer can be uploaded into the storage using the <<gui_FileUploadField,FileUpload>> and <<gui_FileMultiUploadField,FileMultiUpload>> components. Usage examples are provided in this manual in the appropriate component descriptions, as well as in <<images_recipe>>.

`FileUpload` component is also available within the ready-to-use <<dialogs_fileUploadDialog,FileUploadDialog>> window designed to load files in the temporary storage.

The temporary client-level storage (`FileUploadingAPI`) stores temporary files in the folder defined by <<cuba.tempDir,cuba.tempDir>> application property. Temporary files can remain in the folder in case of any failures. The `clearTempDirectory()` method of the `cuba_FileUploading` bean is invoked periodically by the scheduler defined in the <<spring.xml,cuba-web-spring.xml>> file.
