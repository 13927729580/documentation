===== Email Attachments

The `EmailAttachment` object is a wrapper that holds the attachment as a byte array (the `data` field), the file name (the `name` field), and, if necessary, the attachment identifier which is unique for this message (the optional but useful `contentId` field).

The attachment identifier may be used to insert images in the message body. For this, a unique `contentId` (for example, `myPic`) is specified when creating `EmailAttachment`. Expression like `cid:myPic` can be used as a path to insert the attachment in the message body. So, to insert an image you can specify the following HTML element:

[source, xml]
----
<img src="cid:myPic"/>
