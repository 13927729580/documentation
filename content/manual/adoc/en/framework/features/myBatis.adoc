[[myBatis]]
==== Integration with MyBatis

The platform includes *MyBatis* framework, which offers wider capabilities for running SQL and mapping query results to objects compared to ORM <<nativeQuery,native query>> or <<queryRunner,QueryRunner>>.

The following beans must be added into <<spring.xml,spring.xml>> file of the *core* module to use MyBatis in the project:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/features/MyBatis.xml[]
----

The `MapperLocations` parameter defines a path to `mapperLocations` mapping files (according to the rules of `ResourceLoader` Spring interface).

Below is the an example of a mapping file for loading an instance of `Order` together with a related `Customer` and a collection of `Order` items:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/features/mapper.xml[]
----

The following code can be used to retrieve query results from the example above:

[source, java]
----
Transaction tx = persistence.createTransaction();
try {
  SqlSession sqlSession = AppBeans.get("sqlSession");
  Order order = (Order) sqlSession.selectOne("com.sample.sales.selectOrder", orderId);
  tx.commit();
} finally {
  tx.end();
}
