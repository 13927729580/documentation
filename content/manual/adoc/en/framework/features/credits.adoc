==== Information about Software Components

The platform provides an ability to register the information about third party software components used in the application (credits) and to display this information in the UI. The information includes a software component name, a website link and the license text.

<<app_components,Application components>> of the platform contain their own files with descriptions, like `com/haulmont/cuba/credits.xml`, `com/haulmont/reports/credits.xml` and so on. The <<cuba.creditsConfig,cuba.creditsConfig>> application property can be used to specify a description file of the application.

The structure of the `credits.xml` file is as follows:

* The `items` element lists the used libraries with license texts included either as an embedded `license` element, or as a `license` attribute with a link to the text in the `licenses` section.
+
It is possible to reference licenses declared in the current file as well as any other file declared in `cuba.creditsConfig` variable prior to the current one.

* The `licenses` element lists the texts of general licenses used (e.g. LGPL).

The entire list of third-party software components can be displayed using the `com/haulmont/cuba/gui/app/core/credits/credits-frame.xml` frame, which loads the information from the files defined in the `cuba.creditsConfig` property. An example of the frame within a screen:

[source, xml]
----
<dialogMode width="500" height="400"/>
<layout expand="creditsBox">
  <groupBox id="creditsBox"
            caption="msg://credits"
            width="100%">
      <frame id="credits"
              src="/com/haulmont/cuba/gui/app/core/credits/credits-frame.xml"
              width="100%"
              height="100%"/>
  </groupBox>
</layout>
----

If the dialog mode (`WindowManager.OpenType.DIALOG`) is used when opening the screen that contains the frame, the height must be specified; otherwise, the scrolling may work not correctly. See the `dialogMode` element in the example above.
