[[orm]]
==== ORM Layer

Object-Relational Mapping is a technology for linking relational database tables to programming language objects. CUBA uses the ORM implementation based on the *EclipseLink* framework.

ORM provides some obvious benefits:

* Enables working with a relational DBMS by means of Java objects manipulation.
* Simplifies programming by eliminating routine writing of SQL queries.
* Simplifies programming by letting you load and save entire object graphs with one command.
* Ensures easy porting of the application to different DBMS.
* Enables use of a concise object query language â€“ <<jpql, JPQL>>.

At the same time, there are some drawbacks too. First of all, a developer working with ORM directly should have a good understanding of how it works. Also, ORM makes direct optimization of SQL and usage of the DBMS specifics difficult.

[TIP]
====
If you have any performance issues with the database access, the first thing to check is what SQL statements are actually executed. Use `eclipselink.sql` <<logging_useful_loggers,logger>> to output all SQL statements produced by ORM to the log file.
