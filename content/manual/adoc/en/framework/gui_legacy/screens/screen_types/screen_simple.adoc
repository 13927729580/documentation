====== Simple Screen

Simple screens enable displaying and editing of arbitrary information including individual instances and lists of entities. Screens of this type have only the core functionality for opening in the application's main window and working with <<datasources,datasources>>.

The controller of a simple screen must be inherited from the <<abstractWindow,AbstractWindow>> class.

[TIP]
====
You can create a simple screen in Studio using the *Blank screen* template.
