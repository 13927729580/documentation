==== Application Tiers and Blocks

The platform enables building applications according to the classic three-tier pattern: client tier, middleware, database. The _tier_ indicates the degree of "remoteness" from the stored data.

Further on, mainly middleware and client tiers will be described, therefore the words "all tiers" will refer to these tiers only.

Each tier enables creating one or more application _blocks_. A block is a separate executable program interacting with other blocks in the application. CUBA platform tools enable the creation of blocks in the form of web or desktop applications.

Middleware:: The middle tier contains core business logic of the application and provides access to the database. It is represented by a separate web application running on <<javaee_web_profile, Java EE Web Profile>> standard container. See <<middleware>>.

Web Client:: A main block of the client tier. It contains the interface designed primarily for internal users. It is represented by a separate web application running on Java EE Web Profile standard container. The user interface is implemented on the base of *Vaadin* framework. See <<gui_framework>>.

Desktop Client:: An additional block of the client tier. It contains the interface designed primarily for internal users. It is represented by a desktop Java application; the user interface is implemented on the base of *Java Swing* framework. See <<gui_framework>>.

Web Portal:: An additional block of the client tier. It can contain an interface for external users and entry points for integration with mobile devices and third-party applications. It is represented by a separate web application running on Java EE Web Profile standard container. The user interface is implemented on the base of *Spring MVC* framework. See <<portal>>.

Polymer Client:: An optional client designed for external users and written in pure JavaScript. It is based on https://www.polymer-project.org[Google Polymer] framework and communicates with the middleware via <<rest_api_v2,REST API>> running either in Web Client or in Web Portal blocks. See <<polymer_ui>>.

*Middleware* is the mandatory block for any application. User interface can be implemented by one or several blocks, such as *Web Client* and *Polymer Client*.

All of the Java-based client blocks interact with the middle tier uniformly via HTTP protocol enabling to deploy the middle tier arbitrarily, behind a firewall as well. In the simplest case when the middle tier and the web client are deployed on the same server local interaction between them can bypass the network stack for better performance.
