==== Adding Frontend UI in Studio

In order to add the frontend client module to your project:

* Open CUBA project tree in CUBA Studio;
* Right-click on the *Modules* node;
* Select *Manage modules > Create 'front' module* item.

Studio will install https://github.com/cuba-platform/front-generator/tree/{git_branch}[frontend generator] in `modules/front/generation` folder (it may take a while). Then you will be prompted to choose what preset you want to use for your frontend: <<polymer_ui, Polymer>> or <<react_ui,React>>.

After creating the module, start the application server and open `++http://localhost:8080/app-front++` in a web browser. You will be presented with a login form. After logging in, the main window with a vertical menu and responsive layout will be shown.
