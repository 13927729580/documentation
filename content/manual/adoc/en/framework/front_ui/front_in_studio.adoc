==== Adding Frontend UI in Studio

In order to add the frontend client module to your project:

* open CUBA project tree in CUBA Studio;
* right click on `Modules` node;
* select `Manage modules` item;
* click `Create 'front' module`.

Studio will install https://github.com/cuba-platform/front-generator/tree/release_7_0/[frontend generator] in 'modules/front/generation' folder (it may take a while). Then you will be prompted to choose what preset do you want to use for you frontend (<<polymer_ui, Polymer>> or <<react_ui,React>>)

After creating the module, start the application server and open `++http://localhost:8080/app-front++` in a web browser. You will be presented with a login form. After logging in, the main window with a vertical menu and responsive layout will be shown.
