==== Connecting a Debugger

You can start Tomcat server in debug mode by either running the <<build_task_start,Gradle task>>

`gradlew start`

or by running the `++bin/debug.*++` command file of the installed *Tomcat*.

After this, the server will accept debugger connections over port 8787. Port number can be changed in the `++bin/setenv.*++` file, in the `++JPDA_OPTS++` variable.

For debugging in *Intellij IDEA* you need to create a new *Remote* type *Run/Debug Configuration* element in the application project and set its *Port* property to 8787.
