=== Creating a Project

The recommended way to create a new project is to use *CUBA Studio*. An example can be found in the <<qs_create_project,Quick Start>> chapter of this manual.

Once the project is created, you can keep developing it in the Studio, or create *IntelliJ IDEA* or *Eclipse* project files and open the project in the IDE.
