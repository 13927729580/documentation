==== Middleware Integration Tests

In the middle tier, you can create integration tests which run in a fully functional Spring container connected to the database. In such tests you can run code from any layer of the Middleware, from services to ORM.

First, create the `test` directory in your *core* module next to the `src` directory. Re-create IDE project files to be able to run tests from the IDE.

The platform contains the `TestContainer` class which can be used as a base class for the test container in the application project. Create a subclass in the `test` directory of your *core* module and, in its constructor, redefine parameters for loading <<app_components, components>> and <<app_properties_files, application properties>> and test database connection parameters. For example:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/development/testing_3.java[]
----

An example of the custom `test-app.properties` file:

[source, properties]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/development/testing_11.properties[]
----

We recommend using a separate test database, which can be created, for example, by the following Gradle <<build.gradle_createDb, task>> defined in `build.gradle`:

[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/development/testing_4.java[]
----

The test container should be used in test classes as a JUnit rule specified by the `@ClassRule` annotation:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/development/testing_5.java[]
----

In the example above, the test container is initialized once for all test methods of this class, and disposed after all of them finished.

As the container startup takes some time, you may want to initialize the container once for all tests contained in several test classes. In this case, create a common singleton instance of your test container:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/development/testing_6.java[]
----

And use it in your test classes:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/development/testing_7.java[]
----

Useful container methods::
+
--
The `TestContainer` class contains the following methods that can be used in the test code (see the `CustomerLoadTest` example above):

* `persistence()` – returns the reference to the <<persistence,Persistence>> interface.

* `metadata()` – returns the reference to the <<metadata,Metadata>> interface.

* `deleteRecord()` – this set of overloaded methods is aimed to be used in `@After` methods to clean up the database after tests.
--

Logging::
+
--
The test container sets up logging according to the `test-logback.xml` file provided by the platform. It is contained in the root of the `cuba-core-tests` artifact.

If you want to configure logging levels for your tests, do the following:

* Copy `test-logback.xml` from the platform artifact to the root of the `test` folder of your project's `core` module, e.g. as `my-test-logback.xml`.

* Configure appenders and loggers in `my-test-logback.xml`.

* Add a static initializer to your test container to specify the location of your logback configuration file in the `logback.configurationFile` system property:

[source, java]

[[integration_tests_mw_data_store]]
Additional Data Stores::
+
--
If your project uses <<data_store,additional data stores>>, you should create corresponding JDBC data sources in your test container. For example, if you have `mydb` datastore which is a PostgreSQL database, add the following method to the test container class:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/development/testing_10.java[]
----

Also, if the additional database type is different from the main one, you should add its driver as the `testRuntime` dependency to the `core` module in `build.gradle`, for example:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/development/testing_12.groovy[]
----
