==== Client Tier Integration Tests

Client tier integration tests can be implemented using link:http://jmockit.github.io[JMockit] framework. It helps isolating the tests from the Middleware and creating the required infrastructure objects.

Client integration test class should be inherited from `CubaClientTestCase`. In the `@Before` method, you should call the inherited methods `addEntityPackage()`, `setViewConfig()` and then `setupInfrastructure()` to create <<metadata,Metadata>> and <<configuration,Configuration>> objects and deploy metadata for selected entities. Then, in the `@Before` method, you can extend the infrastructure with required mock objects using `Expectations` or `NonStrictExpectations`.

An example of an initialized `@Before` method from one of the platform tests:
