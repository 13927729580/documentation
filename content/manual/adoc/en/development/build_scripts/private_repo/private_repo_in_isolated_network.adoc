===== Repository in an Isolated Network

If you need to develop on CUBA in a network without connection to the internet, do the following:

- Install a copy of the repository manager in the target network.

- Copy the cached content of the <<private_repo_configure,repository>> from the open network to the isolated one. If you followed the instructions above, the content is stored in
+
----
c:\nexus-2.14.3-02\sonatype-work
----

- Restart the *nexus* service.

If you need to add artifacts of a new platform version to the isolated repository, go to the environment connected to the internet, make a build through its repository and then copy the contents to the isolated environment again.
