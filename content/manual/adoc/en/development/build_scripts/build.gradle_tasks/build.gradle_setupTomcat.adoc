[[build.gradle_setupTomcat]]
===== setupTomcat

`setupTomcat` â€“ the task of the `CubaSetupTomcat` type which performs installation and initialization of the local Tomcat server for subsequent <<fast_deployment,fast deployment>> of the application. This task is automatically added to the project when you apply the *cuba* Gradle plugin, so you don't need to declare it in `build.gradle`. Tomcat installation directory is specified by the `tomcat.dir` property of the `cuba` section. By default, it is the project's `build/tomcat` subdirectory.
