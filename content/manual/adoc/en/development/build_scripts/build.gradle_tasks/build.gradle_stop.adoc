[[build.gradle_stop]]
===== stop

`stop` â€“ the task of `CubaStopTomcat` type which stops the local Tomcat server installed by the <<build.gradle_setupTomcat,setupTomcat>> task. This task is automatically added to the project when you include the *cuba* plugin, so you don't need to declare it in `build.gradle`.
