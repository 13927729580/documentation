[[build.gradle_zipProject]]
===== zipProject

`zipProject` is the task of the `CubaZipProject` type which creates a ZIP archive of your project. The archive will not contain IDE project files, build results and Tomcat server. But HSQL database is included to the archive if present in the `build` directory.

This task is automatically added to the project when you apply the *cuba* Gradle plugin, so you donâ€™t need to declare it in `build.gradle`.
