==== Starting Build Tasks

[WARNING]
====
This section will be updated before release 7.0
====

Gradle tasks described in build scripts can be launched in the following ways:

* If you are working with the project in CUBA Studio, all commands under the *CUBA > Build tasks* main menu item actually connect to the Gradle daemon (launched at the start of Studio server) and run corresponding tasks.

* Alternatively, you can use the executable `gradlew` script (Gradle wrapper) included in the project.
////
The script should be located in the project root directory and can be created in Studio using the *Build* > *Create Gradle wrapper* command.
////

* One more way is to use the manually installed Gradle version {gradleVersion}. In this case, run the `gradle` executable located in the `bin` subdirectory of the Gradle installation.

[TIP]
====
It is recommended to run the `gradlew` and `gradle` commands with the `--daemon` argument; in this case the Gradle daemon is retained in memory, which significantly accelerates the subsequent execution.

To remove the daemon from memory, you can use the `--stop` argument.
====

For example, in order to compile the Java files and build the JAR files for project artifacts, you need to run the following command:

[source]
----
gradlew --daemon assemble
----

[WARNING]
====
If your project uses Premium Add-ons and you are starting build tasks outside Studio, you should pass the Premium Add-ons repository credentials to Gradle. See the section <<access_to_premium_repo, above>> for details.
====

Typical build tasks in their normal usage sequence are provided below.

* `idea`, `eclipse` – create IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse project files. When this task is executed, dependencies with their source code are loaded from the artifact repository to the local Gradle cache.

* `cleanIdea`, `cleanEclipse` – remove IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse project files.

* `assemble` – compile Java files and build JARs for project artifacts in the `build` subdirectories of the modules.

* `clean` – remove `build` subdirectories of all project modules.

* <<build.gradle_setupTomcat,setupTomcat>> – setup the Tomcat server to the path that is specified by the `cuba..tomcat.dir` property of the `build.gradle` script.

* <<build.gradle_deploy,deploy>> – deploy the application to the Tomcat server that has been pre-installed by the `setupTomcat` task.

* <<build.gradle_createDb,createDb>> – create an application database and run the corresponding <<db_scripts,scripts>>.

* <<build.gradle_updateDb,updateDb>> – update the existing application database by running the corresponding <<db_scripts,scripts>>.

* <<build.gradle_start,start>> – start the Tomcat server.

* <<build.gradle_stop,stop>> – stop the running Tomcat server.

* <<build.gradle_restart,restart>> – sequentially run the `stop`, `deploy`, `start` tasks.
