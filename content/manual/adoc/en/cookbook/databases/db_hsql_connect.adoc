==== Connecting to HSQLDB with Squirrel SQL

*HSQLDB*, also called *HyperSQL*, is a convenient DBMS for application prototyping that does not require installation and is started automatically within CUBA Studio if the project has been configured to work with this DBMS. This section describes the way of connecting to HSQLDB with an external tool that allows working with DB schema and data directly via SQL.

*SquirreL SQL Client* is an open-source Java application that enables working with databases via JDBC. You can download Squirrel SQL here: http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net.

Before starting *Squirrel SQL*, find the `hsqldb-x.x.x.jar` file in the `lib` folder of your *CUBA Studio* installation and copy it to the `lib` folder of *Squirrel SQL*.

Start *Squirrel SQL* and go to *Drivers*. Make sure that *HSQLDB Server* driver is active.

Open *Aliases* tab and click the *Create a new Alias* button.

Fill in the connection properties in the window that appears: Database URL, User Name and Password. The default user name is "sa", the password is empty. The database URL can be copied from the *Project properties* section of CUBA project view, or from the `modules/core/web/META-INF/context.xml` file of the application project.
