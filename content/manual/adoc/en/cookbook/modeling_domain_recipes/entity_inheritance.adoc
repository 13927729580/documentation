This section demonstrates how to use entity inheritance in CUBA applications.

Let's assume that we have two types of clients - companies and individuals, which have some common attributes. We would like to store the common attributes in one table and use separate linked tables to store specific attributes.

So, the data model contains the `Client` entity, which is a base class stored in the `SAMPLE_CLIENT` table. The `Company` and `Person` entities are stored in separate tables with foreign keys that reference the base table.

The `Order` entity has a reference to `Client`. As the client can be of the different types, when users create orders, they should be able to choose the type of the client.

{proj_model}/blob/master/modules/global/src/com/company/sample/entity/clients/Client.java[Client.java] entity:

* Inheritance strategy is set to `JOINED`
* Discriminator column name `DTYPE` and type String are left default
* Discriminator value is set to `C`

{proj_model}/blob/master/modules/global/src/com/company/sample/entity/clients/Company.java[Company.java] entity:

* Parent class is set to `Client`
* Discriminator value is set to `M`

{proj_model}/blob/master/modules/global/src/com/company/sample/entity/clients/Person.java[Person.java] entity:

* Parent class is set to `Client`
* Discriminator value is set to `P`

The {proj_model}/blob/master/modules/web/src/com/company/sample/web/order/OrderEdit.java[OrderEdit.java] screen controller contain the Client selection components and logic.
