The one-to-one composition will be illustrated by the `Customer` and `CustomerDetails` entities:

* {proj_model}/blob/master/modules/global/src/com/company/sample/entity/customers/Customer.java[Customer.java] - the `Customer` entity contains an optional link to `CustomerDetails` annotated with `@Composition`.

* {proj_model}/blob/master/modules/global/src/com/company/sample/entity/customers/CustomerDetails.java[CustomerDetails.java] - the `CustomerDetails` entity.

* {proj_model}/blob/master/modules/web/src/com/company/sample/web/customers_2/customer-edit.xml[customer-edit.xml] - the customer edit screen descriptor. It contains a nested datasource for the `CustomerDetails` instance. In order to load the nested instance, the root datasource uses a <<views,view>> of the `Customer` entity that includes the `details` attribute. The field group in the customer edit screen just declares a field for the `details` attribute.

As a result, customer editing works as follows:

* The customer edit screen contains the <<gui_PickerField,PickerField>> component with two actions: <<openAction,OpenAction>> and <<clearAction,ClearAction>>:

* When the open action is invoked, a new instance of `CustomerDetails` is created and its edit screen is shown. When *OK* is clicked in the details editor, the details instance is not saved to the database, but to the `detailsDs` datasource of the customer edit screen.

* The picker field displays the <<namePattern_annotation,instance name>> of the details entity:

* When a user clicks *OK* in the customer edit screen, the updated `Customer` instance together with the `CustomerDetails` instance is submitted to the `DataManager.commit()` method on the Middleware and saved to the database within a single transaction.

* If the user invokes the clear action of the picker field, the `CustomerDetails` instance is deleted and the reference to it is cleared in the same transaction after the user commits the customer editor.
