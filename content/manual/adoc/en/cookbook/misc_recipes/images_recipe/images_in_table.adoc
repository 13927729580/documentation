===== Displaying Images in a Table Column

To amplify the previous task, let's add pictures to the table as employees' icons on the `Employee` browse screen.

The pictures can be displayed in a separate column or inside any existing column. In both cases the <<gui_Table_addGeneratedColumn,Table.ColumnGenerator>> interface is used.

Below is a fragment of the `Employee` browse screen XML descriptor:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/cookbook/images_4.xml[]
----

To display pictures inline with an employee's name in the `name` column, let's change the standard representation of data in this column. We will use the <<gui_BoxLayout,HBoxLayout>> container and place the <<gui_Image,Image>> component into it:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/cookbook/images_5.java[]
----

* The `init()` method invokes the `addGeneratedColumn()` method that takes two parameters: an identifier of the column and an implementation of the `Table.ColumnGenerator` interface. The latter is used to define the custom representation of data in the `name` column.

* Inside this method we create an `Image` component using the `UiComponents` interface. We set the <<gui_Image_scaleMode,scale mode>> of the component (`CONTAIN`) and its size parameters.

* Then we get the `FileDescriptor` instance with the picture stored in the <<file_storage,File Storage>>. The link to this picture is stored in the `imageFile` attribute of the `Employee` entity. The `FileDescriptorImageResource` resource type is used to set the source for the `Image` component.

* We will display the `name` attribute in the `Label` component alongside the picture.

* We will wrap both `Image` and `Label` components into the `HBoxLayout` container, and make the `addGeneratedColumn()` method return this container as the new table cell layout.

You can also use a more declarative approach with the <<gui_Table_column_generator,generator>> XML attribute.
