===== Creating a GWT component

In this section, we will cover the creation of a simple GWT component (a rating field consisting of 5 stars) and its usage in application screens.

Create a new project in CUBA Studio and name it `ratingsample`.

Click the *Create web-toolkit module* link in the *Project properties* section of CUBA project view.

// TODO update Studio flow
Click the *New UI component* link. The *UI component generation* page will open. Select the *New GWT component* value in the *Component type* section.

Enter `RatingFieldServerComponent` in the *Vaadin component class name* field.

Deselect the *Integrate into Generic UI* flag. The process of integration into the Generic UI is the same as described at <<vaadin_addon_sample_gui>>, so we won't repeat it here.

After clicking the *OK* button Studio generates the following files:

* `RatingFieldWidget.java` - a GWT widget in *web-toolkit* module.

* `RatingFieldServerComponent.java` - a Vaadin component class.

* `RatingFieldState.java` - a component state class.

* `RatingFieldConnector.java` - a connector that links the client code with the server component.

* `RatingFieldServerRpc.java` - a class that defines a server API for the client.

Let's look at the generated files and make necessary changes in them.

* `RatingFieldWidget` is a GWT widget. Replace its content with the following code:
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/gwt/RatingFieldWidget.java[]
----
+
A widget is a client-side class responsible for displaying the component in the web browser and handling events. It defines interfaces for working with the server side. In our case these are the `setValue()` method and the `StarClickListener` interface.

* `RatingFieldServerComponent` is a Vaadin component class. It defines an API for the server code, accessor methods, event listeners and data sources connection. Developers use the methods of this class in the application code.
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/gwt/RatingFieldServerComponent.java[]
----

* The `RatingFieldState` state class defines what data are sent between the client and the server. It contains public fields that are automatically serialized on server side and deserialized on the client.
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/gwt/RatingFieldState.java[]
----

* The `RatingFieldServerRpc` interface defines a server API that is used from the client-side. Its methods may be invoked by the RPC mechanism built into Vaadin. We will implement this interface in the component.
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/gwt/RatingFieldServerRpc.java[]
----

* The `RatingFieldConnector` connector links client code with the server.
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/gwt/RatingFieldConnector.java[]
----

The `RatingFieldWidget` class does not define the component appearance, it only assigns style names to key elements. To define an appearance of the component, we'll create stylesheet files. Click *Manage themes* -> *Create theme extension* in CUBA Project view. Select the `halo` theme in the dialog. Studio creates SCSS files for the <<web_theme_extension,theme extension>> in the `themes` directory of the *web* module. The `halo` theme uses *FontAwesome* font glyphs instead of <<icon_set,icons>>. We'll use this fact.

It is recommended to put component styles into a separate file `componentname.scss` in the `components/componentname` directory in the form of SCSS mixture. Create the `components/ratingfield` directories structure in the `themes/halo` directory of the *web* module. Then create the `ratingfield.scss` file inside the `ratingfield` directory:

image::ui_component/gwt_theme_ext_structure.png[align="center"]

[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/gwt/ratingfield.scss[]
----

Include this file in the `halo-ext.scss` main theme file:

[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/gwt/halo-ext.scss[]
----

To demonstrate how the component works let's create a new screen in the *web* module.

Name the screen file `rating-screen.xml`.

image::ui_component/gwt_rating_screen_designer.png[align="center"]

Open the `rating-screen.xml` file in the IDE. We need a container for our component. Declare it in the screen XML:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/gwt/rating-screen.xml[]
----

Open the `RatingScreen.java` screen controller and add the code that puts the component to the screen.

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/gwt/RatingScreen.java[]
----

Start the application server and see the result.
