===== Using a JavaScript library

In this example, we will use the https://jqueryui.com/slider/#range[Slider] component from the *jQuery UI* library. The slider will have two drag handlers that define a values range.

Create a new project in CUBA Studio and name it `jscomponent`.

// TODO update Studio flow
Click the *New UI component* button on the *Project properties* navigator section. The *UI component generation* will open. Select the `JavaScript component` value in the `Component type` section.

Enter `SliderServerComponent` in the *Vaadin component class name* field.

Deselect the *Integrate into Generic UI* flag. The process of integration into the Generic UI is the same as described at <<vaadin_addon_sample_gui>>, so we won't repeat it here.

After clicking the *OK* button Studio will generate the following files:

* `SliderServerComponent` - a Vaadin component integrated with JavaScript.

* `SliderState` - a state class of the Vaadin component.

* `slider-connector.js` - a JavaScript connector for the Vaadin component.

Let's examine the generated files and make necessary changes in the source code.

* `SlideState` state class defines what data is transferred between the server and the client. In our case it is a minimal possible value, maximum possible value and selected values.
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/js/SliderState.java[]
----

* Vaadin server-side component `SliderServerComponent`.
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/js/SliderServerComponent.java[]
----
+
The server component defines getters and setters to work with the slider state and an interface of value change listeners. The class extends `AbstractJavaScriptComponent`.
+
The `addFunction()` method invocation in the class constructor defines a handler for an RPC-call of the `valueChanged()` function from the client.
+
The `@JavaScript` and `@StyleSheet` annotations point to files that must be loaded on the web page. In our example, these are JavaScript files of the jquery-ui library, the connector and the stylesheet for jquery-ui. You should place these files to the Java package of the Vaadin server component.

Download an archive with jQuery UI from http://jqueryui.com/download and put files `jquery-ui.js` and `jquery-ui.css` from the archive to the Java package of the `SliderServerComponent` class. At the jQuery UI download page, you can select which components should be put into the archive. For this demo, it is enough to select only the `Slider` item of the `Widgets` group.

* JavaScript connector `slider-connector.js`.
+
[source, javascript]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/js/slider-connector.js[]
----
+
Connector is a function that initializes a JavaScript component when the web page is loaded. The function name must correspond to the server component class name where dots in package name are replaced with underscore characters.
+
Vaadin adds several useful methods to the connector function. `this.getElement()` returns an HTML DOM element of the component, `this.getState()` returns a state object.
+
Our connector does the following:
+
--
* Initializes the `slider` component of the jQuery UI library. The `slide()` function is invoked when the position of any drag handler changes. This function in turn invokes the `valueChanged()` connector method. `valuedChanged()` is the method that we defined on the server side in the `SliderServerComponent` class.

* Defines the `onStateChange()` function. It is called when the state object is changed on the server side.
--

To demonstrate how the component works, let's create the `Product` entity with three attributes:

* `name` of type String
* `minDiscount` of type Double
* `maxDiscount` of type Double

Generate standard screens for the entity. Ensure that the value of the *In module* field is `Web Module`.

The `slider` component will set minimal and maximum discount values of a product.

Open the `product-edit.xml` file. Make `minDiscount` and `maxDiscount` fields not editable by adding the `editable="false"` attribute to the corresponding elements. Then add the new custom `slider` field to the `fieldGroup`.

As a result, the XML descriptor of the editor screen should look as follows:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/js/product-edit.xml[]
----

Open the `ProductEit.java` file. Replace its content with the following code:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/js/ProductEdit.java[]
----

The `initNewItem()` method sets initial values for discounts of a new product.

Method `init()` initializes the `slider` custom field. It sets current, minimal and maximum values of the `slider` and defines the value change listener. When the drag handler moves, a new value will be set to the corresponding field of the editable entity.

Start the application server and open the product editor screen. Changing the drop handler position must change the value of the text fields.
