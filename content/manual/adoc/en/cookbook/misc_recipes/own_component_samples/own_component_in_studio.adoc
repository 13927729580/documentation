===== Support for Custom Visual Components in CUBA Studio

This section describes how to integrate a new custom visual component into CUBA Studio. As a result of the integration, the component will be available on the component palette of the WYSIWYG screen layout designer. Developers will be able to drag and drop the component to the canvas and edit its properties in the properties panel.

Let's walk through the process of integrating the `stepper` component into Studio. Creation of this component was described in <<vaadin_addon_sample_gui>>.

Open the project containing the `stepper` component.

[TIP]
====
If you didn't create this project, you can still reproduce the steps listed below in a new project. In this case, you will see how Studio supports the component, but you won't be able to run the application.
====

Click the *Extend Studio* link on the *Project properties* navigator section.

In the *Extend Studio* screen, fill in the following fields:

* *Configuration name* - a configuration identifier. Enter `stepper`.

* *Component XML element* - a component element name to use in screen XML descriptors. It is `stepper` in our case.
+
The *Component class name* and *Component model class name* fields are filled automatically based on the value of the *Component XML element*. Leave the values as is.

* *Component namespace URI* - a namespace from the XSD that describes the Generic UI component. If you've generated the new component with Studio, then you can take the value of this field from the `ui-component.xsd` file located in the *gui* module.

* *Component namespace prefix* - a prefix for the component XML element.

* *Standard properties* - standard properties that should be available for editing in the component properties panel of the Studio screen layout designer.
+
Select `caption`, `datasource` and `property` checkboxes.
+
[TIP]
====
`id`, `align`, `height`, `width`, `enable`, `stylename` and `visible` properties are available to any component by default.
====

* *Custom properties* - this table is used for declaring component specific properties that should be edited in the component properties panel.
+
--
Add the following properties:

* *manualInput* of type `Boolean`, the default value is `true`

* *mouseWheel* of type `Boolean`, the default value is `true`

* *stepAmount*, of type `Integer`, the default value is `0`

* *maxValue*, of type `Integer`, the default value is `0`

* *minValue*, of type `Integer`, the default value is `0`
--

Press the *OK* button.

The custom visual components support is initialized when the Studio server start. Go to the Studio server window, stop the server, exit Studio, then reopen and start it again.

Re-create standard screens for the `Customer` entity to erase the results of our previous experiments.

Then go to the *GENERIC UI* navigator section and open the `customer-edit.xml` screen.

Remove the `score` field from `fieldGroup` because we will use a separate component for editing the score.

Find the new `Stepper` component on the components palette, then drag it to the screen below `fieldGroup`.

Select the `stepper` component and go to the component *Properties* tab.

Fill in the fields:

* *id* - `stepper`

* *caption* - `Stepper`

* *datasource* - `customerDs`

* *property* - `score`

* *maxValue* - `50`

Go to the *XML* tab to see the result.

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/ui_component/studio_support/customer-edit.xml[]
----

There is a new namespace with the `app` prefix in the screen XML, the `stepper` component is added to the screen, and its properties are set correctly.
