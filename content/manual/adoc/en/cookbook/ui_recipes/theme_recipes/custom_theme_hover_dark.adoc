===== Creating Hover Dark Theme

Here you can find the steps to create a Hover Dark theme, which will be a dark variation of the default Hover theme. The sample application with this theme is available on https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-hover-dark[GitHub].

. Create the new *hover-dark* theme in your project following the instructions in <<web_theme_creation,>> section.
+
The required file structure will be created in the *web* module. The `webThemesModule` module and its configuration will be automatically added to the `settings.gradle` and <<build.gradle,build.gradle>> files.

. Override the default <<web_theme_extension_common,style variables>> in the `hover-dark-defaults.scss` file, i.e. replace the variables in it by the following ones:
+
[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_45.scss[]
----

. Using the <<cuba.themeConfig,cuba.themeConfig>> application property define the themes you want to make available in the application:
+
[source, plain]
----
cuba.themeConfig = hover-theme.properties /com/company/demo/web/hover-dark-theme.properties
----

As the result, both themes will be available in the application: the default Hover theme and its dark variation.
