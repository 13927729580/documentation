===== Alignment

[[screen_layout_rules_align]]
Aligning components inside a container::
+
--
Use the <<gui_attr_align,align>> attribute to align components within a container.

For example, here the label is located in the centre of the container:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/cookbook/screen_layout_rules_align.xml[]
----

image::cookbook/screen_layout_rules_15.png[align="center"]

Component with specified alignment should not have 100% size in alignment direction. The container should provide more space than required by the component. The component will be aligned within this space.

The example of alignment within available space:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/cookbook/screen_layout_rules_align.xml[]
----

image::cookbook/screen_layout_rules_16.png[align="center"]
