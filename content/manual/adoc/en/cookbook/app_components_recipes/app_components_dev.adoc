==== Creating Application Components

This section contains some recommendations useful if you are developing a reusable application component.

[[app_components_dev_naming]]
Naming rules::
+
--
. Choose the root package using the standard reverse-DNS notation, e.g. `com.jupiter.amazingsearch`.
+
Root package should not begin with a root package of any other component or application. For example, if you have an application with `com.jupiter.tickets` root package, you cannot use `com.jupiter.tickets.amazingsearch` package for a component. The reason is that Spring scans the classpath for the beans starting from the specified root package, and this scanning space must be unique for each component.

. Namespace is used as a prefix for the database tables, so for a public component it should be composite, like `jptams`, not just `search`. It will minimize the risk of name collisions in the target application. You cannot use underscores and dashes in namespace, only letters and digits.

. Module prefix should repeat namespace, but can contain dashes, like `jpt-amsearch`.

. Use namespace as a prefix for bean names and application properties, for example:
+
[source, java]
----
@Component("jptams_Finder")
@Property("jptams.ignoreCase")
----
--

[[app_components_dev_install_local]]
Installing into the local Maven repository::
+
--
In order to make the component available to the projects located on your computer, install it into the local Maven repository by executing the *Run > Install app component* menu command. This command just runs the `install` Gradle task after stopping Gradle daemons.
--

[[app_components_dev_upload]]
Uploading to a remote Maven repository::
+
--
. Set up a repository as explained in <<private_repo>>.

. Specify your repository and credentials for the project instead of the standard CUBA repository.

. Open `build.gradle` of the component project in a text editor and add `uploadRepository` to the `cuba` section:
+
[source,groovy]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/cookbook/app_comp_upload_1.groovy[]
----

. Open the component project in Studio.

. In the *Search* dialog (Alt-/), find the `uploadArchives` Gradle task and run it. You can also run this task from the command line. The component's artifacts will be uploaded to your repository.

. Remove the component artifacts from your local Maven repository to ensure that they will be downloaded from the remote repository during the next assembling of the application project: just delete the `.m2/repository/com/company` folder located in your user home directory.

. Now, when you assemble and run the application that uses this component, it will be downloaded from the remote repository.

[[app_components_dev_upload_bintray]]
Uploading to Bintray::
+
--
. Register at https://bintray.com/signup/oss
+
[TIP]
====
You can use social login (GitHub, Gmail, Twitter) on Bintray, but later you will have to reset your password, as this account's password is required for getting an API-key (see below).
====

. Get the Bintray user name. It can be found in the URL you see after login to Bintray. For example, in `\https://bintray.com/vividphoenix` the `vividphoenix` is the user name.

. Get the API-key. It can be found in Bintray interface if you edit your profile. In the API-key section, you will be asked to input your account password to obtain the key. Then you will be able to use this key and the username for plugin authentication:
+
** The Bintray credentials can be added as environment variables:
+
[source, plain]
----
BINTRAY_USER=your_bintray_user
BINTRAY_API_KEY=9696c1cb90752357ded8fdf20eb3fa921bf9dbbb
----
+
** Instead of environment variables, you can explicitly define these parameters in the `build.gradle` file of the project:
+
[source, plain]
----
bintray {
    user = 'bintray_user'
    key = 'bintray_api_key'
    ...
}
----
+
** Alternatively, you can provide Bintray credentials in the command line:
+
[source, plain]
----
./gradlew clean assemble bintrayUpload -Pcuba.artifact.version=1.0.0 -PbintrayUser=your_bintray_user -PbintrayApiKey=9696c1cb90752357ded8fdf20eb3fa921bf9dbbb
----

. Create a public repository of _Maven_ type. Setting a license type is mandatory for open source (OSS) repositories.
+
Bintray structure implies using packages inside the repositories. At this stage, creating a package is not mandatory, as it will be automatically created while running the `gradle bintrayUpload` task.

. In your `build.gradle`, add the Bintray upload plugin dependency as follows:
+
[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/cookbook/bintray_plugin.groovy[]
----

. At the end of `build.gradle`, add the Bintray plugin settings:
+
[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/cookbook/bintray_plugin_settings.groovy[]
----
+
** here, `pkg:repo` is your repository (use `main`),
** `pkg:name` is the package name (use your unique name, as `amazingsearch`),
** `pkg:desc` is the optional package description that will be shown on Bintray interface,
** and `pkg:userOrg` - is the name of an organization the repo belongs to (if not set, the `BINTRAY_USER` will be used as the organization name by default).

. Now you can build and upload the project with the following command:
+
[source, plain]
----
./gradlew clean assemble bintrayUpload -Pcuba.artifact.version=1.0.0
----

. If you publish the add-on on the CUBA Marketplace, its repository will be linked to the standard CUBA repositories and users wonâ€™t have to specify your repository in their projects.
