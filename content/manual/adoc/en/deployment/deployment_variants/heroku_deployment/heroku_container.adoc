===== Container Deployment to Heroku

Set up UberJAR building as it is described in the <<docker_deployment>> section. Create a Heroku account and install Heroku CLI. For this purpose, please refer to the <<heroku_war_deployment>> section.

Create the app and connect it to the database with the following command

[source, plain]
----
heroku create cuba-sales-docker --addons heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
----

After the task is completed you have to configure the database credentials in the `jetty-env.xml` file for the connection to the database created by Heroku.

. Go to the https://dashboard.heroku.com.
. Select your project, open the *Resources* tab and select the database.
. In the newly opened window open the *Settings* tab and click the *View Credentials* button.

[[jetty-env]]
Switch to the IDE and open the `jetty-env.xml` file. You have to change the URL (host and database name), user name and password.
Copy credentials from the site and paste them into the file.

----
include::{sourcesdir}/deployment/jetty-env.xml[]

Build the single Uber JAR file using the Gradle task:

[source, plain]
----
gradle buldUberJar
----

Also, you have to add some changes to the `Dockerfile`. First of all, if you use the free account, you have to restrict the amount of memory consumed by the application. Then you need to obtain the port of the app from the Heroku and add it to the image.

The `Dockerfile` should look like the following:

[source, plain]
----
### Dockerfile

FROM openjdk:8

COPY . /usr/src/cuba-sales

CMD java -Xmx512m -Dapp.home=/usr/src/cuba-sales/home -jar /usr/src/cuba-sales/app.jar -port $PORT
----

Set up Git with the following commands:

[source, plain]
----
git init
heroku git:remote -a cuba-sales-docker
git add .
git commit -am "Initial commit"
----

Then log in to the container registry. It's the Heroku location for storing images.

[source, plain]
----
heroku container:login
----

Next, build the image and push it to Container Registry

[source, plain]
----
heroku container:push web
----

Here `web` is the process type of the application. When you run this command, by default Heroku is going to build the image using the `Dockerfile` in the current directory, and then push it to Heroku.

After the deployment process is completed, your application will be accessible in web browser by an URL like https://cuba-sales-docker.herokuapp.com/app

You can also open the application from the Heroku dashboard using the *Open app* button.

The third way to open a running application is to use the following command (remember to add the `app` context to the link, e.g. https://cuba-sales-docker.herokuapp.com/app):

[source, plain]
----
heroku open
----
