===== Single Uber JAR Deployment

Open your project in CUBA Studio, navigate to *Deployment*, go to *UberJAR settings* tab and then configure options as described below.

. Select *Build Uber JAR*
. Select *Single Uber JAR* if it is not selected.
. Click *Generate* button next to the *Logback configuration file* field.
. Click *Generate* button next to the *Custom Jetty environment file* field. Fill your database connection details in modal window.
To use standard PostgreSQL container in application, change the `localhost` to `postgres` in the Database URL field.

Studio adds the <<build.gradle_buildUberJar>> task to the `build.gradle` file. Run this task to create the JAR file:

[source, plain]
----
gradle buildUberJar
----

A Docker image with the CUBA app should be based on OpenJDK. We recommend to use a `Dockerfile` to specify the information that Docker needs to know to run the app — a base Docker image to run from, the location of your project code, any dependencies it has, and what commands to run at startup.

. Create the `docker-image` folder in the project.
. Copy the JAR file into this folder.
. Create a `Dockerfile` with the simple instructions:

[source, plain]
----
### Dockerfile

FROM openjdk:8

COPY . /usr/src/cuba-sales

CMD java -Dapp.home=/usr/src/cuba-sales/home -jar /usr/src/cuba-sales/app.jar
----

* The `FROM` instruction initializes a new build stage and sets the *Base Image* for subsequent instructions.
* The `COPY` instruction copies new files or directories from `<src>` and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the path `<dest>`.
  Multiple `<src>` resources may be specified but they must be relative to the source directory that is being built (the context of the build).
* The main purpose of a `CMD` is to provide defaults for an executing container. These defaults can include an executable, or they can omit the executable, in which case you must specify an `ENTRYPOINT` instruction as well.

To get more information about Dockerfile instructions see the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/[Dockerfile reference].

Now build the image:

. Open the Terminal from the `docker-image` folder.
. Run the build command. The docker `build` command is quite simple - it takes an optional tag name with the `-t` flag
and the location of the directory containing the Dockerfile, the `.` indicates the current directory.

[source, plain]
----
docker build -t cuba-sample-sales .
----

If you don't have the `openjdk:8` image the client will first pull the base image and then create the image.

To define and run multi-container Docker application use the https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/[Docker Compose tool]. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services, so they can be run together in an isolated environment.

A `docker-compose.yml` file looks like this:

[source, plain]
----
version: '2'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:9.6.6
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=cuba
      - POSTGRES_USER=cuba
      - POSTGRES_DB=sales
    ports:
     - "5433:5432"
    networks:
     - sales-network
  web:
    image: cuba-sample-sales
    ports:
     - "8080:8080"
    networks:
     - sales-network

networks:
  sales-network:
----

This compose file defines two services, `web` and `postgres`. The web service:

* uses an image that’s built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
* forwards the exposed port 8080 on the container to port 8080 on the host machine.

The `postgres` service uses a public Postgres image pulled from the Docker Hub registry.

To start the application, go to the directory of the `docker-compose.yml` file and run:

[source, plain]
----
docker-compose up
----

After the task is completed you will be able to open the application at `++http://localhost:8080/app++`
