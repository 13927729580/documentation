==== Deployment to Jelastic Cloud

CUBA Studio allows you to deploy your application to the link:$$https://jelastic.com/$$[Jelastic] cloud in a few easy steps.

[TIP]
====
Please note that only projects using PostgreSQL or HSQL databases are currently supported.
====

. Click the *Deployment settings* link on the *Project properties* section and switch to the *CLOUD* tab.

. If the project is not yet set up for cloud deployment, you can use the field on top to create a free trial Jelastic account.

. After completing your registration, enter the email, password and selected provider.

. *Environment* field defines the environment in which the application WAR will be deployed. Click on the ellipsis button and select an existing environment or create a new one. You can check the selected environment for compatibility with your project. A compatible environment should have Java 8, Tomcat 8 and PostgreSQL 9.1+ (if the project uses PostgreSQL database). If your project uses PostgreSQL, you will receive an email with the database connection details. Please use them when generating custom `context.xml` file, see *Custom context.xml path* field below. Besides, you should create an empty PostgreSQL database using the provider's web interface link containing in the email. The database name should be specified later in custom context.xml (see below).

. If your project uses HSQLDB, that is all - you can press *OK* and start deployment by clicking *Run > Deploy to cloud* main menu item. The deployment parameters can be later adjusted in <<build.gradle_deployWar,build.gradle>>.

. If your project uses PostgreSQL, go to the database administration web interface by the link in the email received after creation of the environment and create a database.

. Press *Generate* button next to the *Custom context.xml path* field and specify the database user, password, host, and name.
