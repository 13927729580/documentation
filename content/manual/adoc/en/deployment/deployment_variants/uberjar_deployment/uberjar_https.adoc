===== Configuring HTTPS for UberJAR

Below is an example of configuring HTTPS with a self-signed certificate for UberJAR deployment.

. Generate keys and certificates with in-built JDK tool `Java Keytool`:
+
[source, plain]
----
keytool -keystore keystore.jks -alias jetty -genkey -keyalg RSA
----

. Create the `jetty.xml` file with SSL configuration in the project root folder:
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/deployment/uberjar-https.xml[]
----
+
The `keyStorePassword`, `keyManagerPassword`, and `trustStorePassword` should correspond to those set by `Keytool`.

. Add `jetty.xml` to the build task configuration:
+
[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/deployment/uberjar-https.groovy[]
----

. Build Uber JAR as described in the <<uberjar_deployment>> section.

. Put the `keystore.jks` in the same folder with JAR distribution of your project and start Uber JAR.
+
The application will be available at `\https://localhost:8443/app`.
