==== WAR deployment to Tomcat Windows Service

. Add the <<build.gradle_buildWar, buildWar>> task to the end of <<build.gradle,build.gradle>>:
+
--
[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/deployment/warDeployment_2.groovy[]
----

If the target server parameters differ from what you have on the local Tomcat used for <<fast_deployment,fast deployment>>, provide appropriate application properties. For example, if the target server runs on port 9999, the task definition should be as follows:

[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/deployment/warDeployment_3.groovy[]
----

You can also specify a different `context.xml` file to setup the connection to the production database, for example:

[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/deployment/warDeployment_4.groovy[]
----
--

. Run the `buildWar` Gradle task. As a result, `app.war` and `app-core.war` files will be generated in the `build/distributions` directory of your project.
+
[source, plain]
----
gradlew buildWar
----

. Download and run Tomcat 8 Windows Service Installer.

. Go to the `bin` directory of the installed server and run `tomcat8w.exe` with the administrative rights.
Set *Maximum memory pool* to 1024MB on the *Java* tab. Then go to the *General* tab and restart the service.
