==== Temporary Directory

This directory can be used by the application for creating arbitrary temporary files at runtime. The path to the temporary directory is determined by the <<cuba.tempDir,cuba.tempDir>> application property. In case of <<fast_deployment,fast deployment>> in Tomcat, it is a subdirectory with the name of the web application in the `tomcat/temp` directory. For other deployment scenarios, the temporary directory is located inside the <<app_home,application home>>.
