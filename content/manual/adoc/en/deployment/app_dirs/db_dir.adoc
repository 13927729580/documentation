[[db_dir]]
==== Database Scripts Directory

This directory contains the set of SQL scripts to create and update the database. It is specific to the Middleware block.

The script directory structure reproduces the one described in <<db_scripts,>>, but it also has an additional top level that separates <<app_components,application components>> and the application scripts. The numbering of top-level directories is performed by project build <<build.gradle,tasks>>.

The DB scripts directory location is determined by <<cuba.dbDir,cuba.dbDir>> application property. For <<fast_deployment,fast deployment>> in Tomcat, it is the `WEB-INF/db` subdirectory of the middleware web application directory: `tomcat/webapps/app-core/WEB-INF/db`. For other deployment scenarios, the database scripts are located in the `/WEB-INF/db` directory inside WAR or UberJAR files.
