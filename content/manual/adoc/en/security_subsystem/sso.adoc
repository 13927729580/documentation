=== Single-Sign-On for CUBA Applications

Single-sign-on (SSO) for CUBA applications allows a user to log in to the multiple running applications by entering a single login name and password once in a browser session.

The IDP addon is designed to simplify setting up SSO in CUBA applications. See  the addon https://github.com/cuba-platform/idp-addon/wiki[documentation] for more details.
