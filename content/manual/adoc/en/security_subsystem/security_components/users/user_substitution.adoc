[[user_substitution]]
===== User Substitution

The system administrator can give a user an ability to _substitute_ another user. The substituting user will have the same <<userSession,session>>, but a different set of <<roles,roles>>, <<constraints,constraints>> and <<session_attr,attributes>>, assigned from the substituted user.

[TIP]
====
It is recommended to use the `UserSession.getCurrentOrSubstitutedUser()` method for retrieving the current user in the application code, which returns the substituted user, if there is an active substitution. The platform audit mechanisms (the `createdBy` and `updatedBy` attributes, <<entity_log,change log>> and <<entity_snapshots,entity snapshots>>) always register the real logged-in user. 
====

If the user has substituted users, a drop-down list will be shown in the application upper right corner instead of the plain text with the current user name:

image::user_subst_select.png[align="center"]

If another user is selected in this list, all opened screens will be closed and the substitution will be made active. The `UserSession.getUser()` method will still return the user that has logged in, however, the `UserSession.getSubstitutedUser()` method will return the substituted user. If there is no substitution, the `UserSession.getSubstitutedUser()` method will return `null`. 

Substituted users can be managed through the *Substituted Users* table in the user edit screen. The user substitution screen is described below:

image::user_subst_edit.png[align="center"]

* *User* – the edited user. This user will substitute another user.

* *Substituted user* – the substituted user.

* *Start date*, *End date* – optional substitution period. User substitution will be unavailable outside of this period. If no period is specified, substitution will be available until this table entry is removed.
