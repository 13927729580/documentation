==== Customization of IDP

IDP Login Form::
+
--
The login form files are located in the `idp` folder of your web application. In case of deployment to Tomcat it is the `tomcat/webapps/app/idp` folder. You can replace the standard files by creating files with the same name in the `web/idp` folder of your project's *web* module.

By default, the IDP login form uses a localization mechanism based on the https://github.com/fabi1cazenave/webL10n[webL10n] JavaScript library and contains messages for English and Russian locales. In order to create messages for other languages, create file `modules/web/web/idp/l10n/locales.ini` and define the list of message files in it:

[source]
----
[*]
@import url(messages.properties)

[ru]
@import url(messages_ru.properties)

[es]
@import url(messages_es.properties)
----

Additional message files must be located in the same folder (`modules/web/web/idp/l10n`). As a template for your message files use the corresponding files from the *cuba-idp* module which is available as a dependency JAR in your project.

You can also completely replace the login form by creating your own `login.html` and `js/login.js` files, or modify the styles in the `css/login.css` file.

IDP Implementation::
+
--
IDP entry points are implemented in the `cuba_IdpController` and `cuba_IdpServiceController` Spring MVC controllers. You can create your own controllers and define them in the `idp-dispatcher-spring.xml` file of your *web* module with the same names to provide a customized behaviour.

In the standard implementation, the IDP sessions are stored on Middleware and replicated in cluster. This functionality is provided by the `cuba_IdpSessionStore` bean. You can customize the sessions storage by creating a bean with the same name in the *core* module of your project and registering it in the corresponding `spring.xml` file. See details in the <<bean_extension,>> section.
