=== Starting the Application

Studio allows you to control the local Tomcat application server which is used for running the application. You can start, stop and restart the application server from the CUBA menu:

When you start the application server, the *Run* tool window displays the executed tasks and the build result:

[source]
----
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s
23 actionable tasks: 5 executed, 18 up-to-date
12:48:10: Tasks execution finished 'deploy start'.
----

As soon as Tomcat server is started, you can open the running application in the web browser using the *Runs At...* CUBA tree section:

On Windows, you will see a console window with the server output. You can stop the server by pressing Ctrl+C in the console.

On Linux and macOS, you can see the server log by executing `tail -f deploy/tomcat/logs/app.log` in the *Terminal* tool window:

A few notes on what the menu commands actually do:

* The *Start Application Server* command builds and deploys the application, then starts the server. So you can execute it at any moment without assembling the application in advance. Under the hood, the command runs the `deploy` and `start` Gradle tasks. It also checks if Tomcat is installed, and if it is not, runs the `setupTomcat` task first.

* The *Stop Application Server* command stops Tomcat by sending the SHUTDOWN signal to the shutdown port specified in the project properties (8005 by default).

* The *Restart Application Server* command stops Tomcat, builds and deploys the application and then starts Tomcat again by executing the `deploy` and `start` Gradle tasks.

The `deploy` and `undeploy` tasks, and hence the *Start Application Server*, *Restart Application Server*, *Build Tasks > Deploy*, *Build Tasks > Undeploy* commands which use them, run the `cleanConf` task to remove hot-deployed code from the configuration directory. The list of what is deleted by this task can be set up in `build.gradle`.
