=== Creating a New Project

CUBA Studio (IntelliJ Edition) provides an easy way to create new CUBA projects from scratch. Just use the *New Project* wizard and follow the steps below:

. Click *Create New Project*.

. Select *CUBA Project* based on JDK 8.

. Configure the access to one or more https://doc.cuba-platform.com/manual-latest/access_to_repo.html[repositories] for the project, or accept default, and click *Next*.

. Specify the name of the new project in the *Project name* field. The name should contain only Latin letters, numbers and underscores. Think carefully on the project name at this stage, as changing it later on will require complex manual intervention.

. The following fields below will be automatically populated:
+
--
* *Project location* – the path to the new project directory. You can select the directory manually by clicking the *...* button next to the field. The *Select folder* window will appear with the list of folders n your hard drive. You can select one of those, or create a new directory by clicking the *+* button.

* *Project namespace* – the namespace which will be used as a prefix for entity names and database tables. The namespace can consist of Latin letters only and should be as short as possible.

* *Root package* − the root package of Java classes. It can be adjusted later, but the classes generated at project creation will not be moved.

* *Platform version* – the platform version used in the project. The platform artifacts will be automatically downloaded from the repository on project build.

. Click *Finish*. The empty project will be created in the specified directory, and the CUBA perspective will appear.

Before starting to work on the project, wait for Gradle and IntelliJ to complete project synchronization and indexing.
