=== Importing an Existing Project

You can open and migrate you existing CUBA projects by following the steps below:

. Remove old IntelliJ project files, manually or using the `gradlew cleanIdea` task in the command line.

. If the project is under Git version control, add `.idea` to the `.gitignore` file.

. Open `build.gradle` file as a project.

. Configure the import settings:
+
--
* Check *Use auto-import* checkbox.

* Select *Use gradle `wrapper` task configuration*.

* Select JDK 8.

* Select `.idea` (directory based) project format.
--

. Wait for Gradle and IntelliJ to complete project import and indexing.

After that, the CUBA perspective will appear, and you can start working on your project.
