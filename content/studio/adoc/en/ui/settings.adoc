=== CUBA Settings

If you click the *CUBA > Settings* main menu item, you will see the IDE settings window filtered by the *cuba* word. Find the *CUBA* section under *Languages & Frameworks*.

The *CUBA* section itself contains the settings common to all projects opened in this Studio instance.

The nested *Project settings* section contains the settings of the currently opened project. All non-default values are stored in the `studio-intellij.xml` file in the project root directory, which can be added to the version control system to share project settings between all developers in your team.
