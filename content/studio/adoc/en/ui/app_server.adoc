=== Working with Application Server

You can start, restart and stop the application server from the CUBA menu:

* The *Start application server* command builds and deploys the application and then starts the server. Under the hood it runs the `deploy` and `start` Gradle tasks. It also checks if Tomcat is installed, and if it is not, runs the `setupTomcat` task first.

* The *Stop application server* command stops Tomcat by sending the SHUTDOWN signal to port 8005.

* The *Restart application server* command stops Tomcat, builds and deploys the application and then starts Tomcat again by executing the `deploy` and `start` Gradle tasks.

[TIP]
====
The `deploy` and `undeploy` tasks, and hence the *Start, Restart, Deploy, Undeploy* commands which use them, run the `cleanConf` task to remove hot-deployed code from the configuration directory. The list of what is deleted by this task can be set up in `build.gradle`.
====

When you start the application server, the terminal window displays the executed tasks and the build result:

As soon as Tomcat server is started, you can open the running application from the *Runs At...* CUBA tree section. either from the context menu or just by a double-click:
