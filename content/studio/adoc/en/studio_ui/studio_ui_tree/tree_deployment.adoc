** *Include JDBC driver* - whether JDBC driver should be included in WAR file.
** *Include Tomcat's context.xml* - whether `context.xml` (Tomcat deployment descriptor) should be included in WAR file.
** *Custom context.xml path* - a path relative to the project root to the `context.xml` Tomcat deployment descriptor. Enabled if *Include Tomcat's context.xml* is checked. Click *Generate* to create this file automatically.
** *Single WAR for Middleware and Web Client* - whether to build a single WAR comprising the Middleware and Web Client application blocks.
** *Custom web.xml path* is the file to be used as a special `web.xml` of the single WAR. Click *Generate* to create this file automatically.
** *Logback configuration file* - a path relative to the project root to the `logback.xml` configuration file. Click *Generate* to create this file automatically.
** *App properties* - a set of application properties to define for this deployment. The properties will be added to the `/WEB-INF/local.app.properties` file inside the WAR.
* *UberJAR Settings* page allows you to set up deployment to Uber JAR. After completing the setup, the https://doc.cuba-platform.com/manual-latest/build.gradle_buildUberJar.html[buildUberJar] task will be created in your `build.gradle`.
