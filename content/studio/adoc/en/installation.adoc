== Installation and Setup

Minimum software requirements are as follows:

Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 8::
+
--
Install JDK 8 and check it by running the following command in the console:

`java -version`

The command should return the Java version, e.g. `++1.8.0_152++`.

[WARNING]
====
Java 9 is not supported yet. You can build and run CUBA applications only on Java 8.
====

In order to build and run projects outside Studio, you need to set the path to the JDK root directory in the `++JAVA_HOME++` environment variable, e.g. `++C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_152++`.

* On *Windows*, you can do this at *Computer* -> *Properties* -> *Advanced System Settings* -> *Advanced* -> *Environment variables*. The value of the variable should be added to the *System variables* list.

* On *macOS*, it is recommended to set `JAVA_HOME` in `~/.bash_profile`:
+
`export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8)`
+
If you install Java 9 on macOS, CUBA Studio and applications won't start, regardless of the `JAVA_HOME` value. In this case, see the *Troubleshooting* section below.
--

Database::
+
--
In the most basic scenario, the built-in *HyperSQL* (link:$$http://hsqldb.org$$[http://hsqldb.org]) can be used as the database server. This is sufficient for exploring the platform capabilities and application prototyping. For building production applications, it is recommended to install and use one of the full-featured DBMS https://doc.cuba-platform.com/manual-latest/dbms_types.html[supported by the platform], like *PostgreSQL* for instance.
--

Web browser::
+
--
The web interface of the platform-based applications supports all popular browsers, including *Google Chrome*, *Mozilla Firefox*, *Safari*, *Opera 15+*, *Internet Explorer 9+*, *Microsoft Edge*. Furthermore, Studio IntelliJ provides its own embedded browser.
--

Troubleshooting::
+
--
. If you install Java 9 on macOS for some reason, CUBA Studio and applications won't start. To recover from this situation, do the following:

.. Make you JDK 9 installation not used by default throughout the system: rename `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-9.0.1.jdk/Contents/Info.plist` file into `Info.plist.disabled` (replace `jdk-9.0.1.jdk` with the actual version of your JDK 9).

.. Replace `JavaAppletPlugin.plugin` installed by Java 9 to the one from Java 8:
*** Remove or rename `/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin`
*** Install JDK 8 again, it will re-create the plugin.

.. Make sure you have specified `JAVA_HOME` with `-v 1.8` argument as shown above. Re-login or `source .bash_profile` after making changes.

. Make sure your environment does not contain `CATALINA_HOME`, `CATALINA_BASE` and `CLASSPATH` variables. They may cause problems starting *Apache Tomcat* web server which is used at development time. Reboot your computer after removing the variables.
