=== CUBA Studio (IntelliJ Edition) Installation

Prerequisites::
+
--
* Make sure that Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 8 is https://doc.cuba-platform.com/manual-latest/setup.html[installed] by running the following command in the console:
+
`java -version`
+
The command should return the Java version, e.g. `++1.8.0_152++`.

* If you are using OpenJDK on Linux, install http://openjdk.java.net/projects/openjfx/[OpenJFX], for example:
+
`sudo apt-get install openjfx`

* If you connect to the internet via a proxy server, some Java system properties must be passed to the JVM running Studio and Gradle. These properties are explained here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html (see properties for HTTP and HTTPS protocols).
+
It is recommended to set these properties system-wide in the `++JAVA_OPTS++` environment variable. The Studio launch script passes `++JAVA_OPTS++` to the Java executable.
