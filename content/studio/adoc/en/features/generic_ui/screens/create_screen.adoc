===== Creating New Screen

You can create new {main_man_url}screens.html[screens] by clicking *New > Screen* in the *Generic UI* context menu.

Moreover, Studio provides a straightforward way of creating standard entity {main_man_url}/screen_lookup.html[lookup] and {main_man_url}/screen_edit.html[editor]:

Select a template in the templates list.

Studio suggests the following predefined templates:

New templates: ::
+
--
* *Blank screen* - not associated with an entity.

* *Entity editor* - standard editor screen with a form and window action buttons: *OK* and *Cancel*. Select *Extended window actions* checkbox to create an editor that can be saved without closing the screen. It will have *Save and close*, *Save* and *Cancel* buttons.

* *Entity lookup and editor screens* - standard lookup and editor screens created at once.

* *Lookup screen* - standard browse and lookup screen with a filter on top and a table consuming all available space.

* *Master-detail screen* - combined screen with the browser on the left and the editor on the right. Editor fields are disabled until a user clicks *Create* or *Edit*.

Legacy templates: ::

* *Entity frame* - frame associated with an entity. It differs from blank frame in that it has datasource defined for selected entity with given view.

* *Extend an existing screen* - a screen based on another screen.

* *Frame* - blank frame. It differs from blank screen in that its controller extends `AbstractFrame`.

* *Login window* - a login window based on the standard `loginWindow` screen provided by the platform.

* *Main window* - a main window based on the standard mainWindow screen provided by the platform.

* *Main window with responsive side menu* - a main window with a responsive side menu on the left side.

Enter the screen properties in the opened window. A screen can be created in one of the client modules: *gui* or *web*.

By default, generic UI screens are created in the *web* module. Other modules are not shown in the tree if they are empty.

The *Advanced* section of *Create CUBA Screen* window lets you modify the default descriptor and controller identifiers. It is useful when you have more than one screen for some entity.

When you click *Finish*, the screen XML descriptor and Java controller files are created. If you select one of the legacy screen templates whose descriptor and controller are not yet annotated with `@UiDescriptor` and `@UiController` annotations respectively, such screen will be automatically registered in the `screens.xml` file of the corresponding module.
