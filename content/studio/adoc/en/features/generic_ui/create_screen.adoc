==== Creating Screens

To create a new Generic UI screen, select *Generic UI* in the project tree and click *New > Screen* in the context menu. If you want to create a CRUD screen for an entity, select this entity or one of its views in the project tree and click *New > Screen* in the context menu:

Studio will show a list of available templates. The list is divided into two sections: *Screen Templates* and *Legacy Screen Templates*. The former contains the templates for the new screen API available since framework version 7, while the latter contains templates for screens that can be used in projects based on version 6 too.

If you are creating the screen for an entity or view selected in the project tree, the *Entity* and *Entity view* fields will be filled automatically:

The *Advanced* section lets you modify the automatically generated descriptor and controller names and the screen id. It is useful when you have more than one screen for some entity.

When you click *Finish*, the screen XML descriptor and Java controller files are created and opened. For a legacy screen not annotated with `UiDescriptor` and/or `@UiController` annotation, its descriptor is registered in the `web-screens.xml` file.

When you remove a screen, you can use the soft deletion mechanism to find and clean up references to this screen. Click *View usages* after deleting a screen descriptor and controller, then click *Do refactor*, and Studio will also delete the screen's mentions from `web-screens.xml` and `web-menu.xml` configuration files.
