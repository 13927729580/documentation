===== XML Descriptor

{main_man_url}/screen_xml.html[XML-descriptor] is a file in XML format that declaratively describes the screen layout and data layer.

You can easily switch from descriptor to controller and back using the marker on the left-hand gutter:

The *Text* tab contains the XML source code itself. All changes in the code will be parsed and reflected in the appropriate *Designer* fields.

Screen inspections::
+
--
Studio inspects the screen layout for errors and inconsistency, checks the internal and external references. It will alert you with warnings or components highlight, for example, in the following cases:

* The screen layout cannot be assembled due to an XML error,
* Components property paths and names do not correspond to the application data model,
* Components sized conflict: conflicting `width`, `height` and `expand` attribute values,
* `dataContainer` and `dataLoader` attributes don't reference any existing data containers or data loaders in the current window or one of windows which include the current one as frame,
* Duplicated element attribute in an extended screen, when attributes are declared identically in both parent and extended screens,
* Fields inside a `form` don't define the `property` XML attribute explicitly: in this case, the `id` will be used as `property` implicitly,
* The `form` element semantic error: fields are duplicated or located out of the `column`,
* The number of columns in a `gridLayout` does not match the stated number,
* Elements in an extended screen are named not like in parent screen or placed incorrectly,
* `messagesPack` descriptor attribute does not belong to a valid package which contains at least one `messages_xx.properties` file,
* Outdated XSD reference,
* `id` values are not unique within the screen.

The inspections can be configured in the *Settings* window (CUBA > Settings > Editor > Inspections).

The *Designer* tab displays the convenient visual designer. It allows designing screen layout and set UI components properties in WYSIWYG style.

The designer workspace is divided into four panels:

* *Canvas* is the workspace where you can arrange the components in the desired layout. Components can be resized and aligned using the controls:
** expand horizontally,
** expand vertically,
** align the component vertically/horizontally.
* The *Palette* panel displays the set of available screen component:
** Non-visual components: actions, dialog mode, timer;
** Data layer: collection of entity instances, single entity instance, key-value collection;
** Containers;
** Components.

In order to add a component to the layout, drag it from the palette onto the canvas or the hierarchy panel.
* The *Hierarchy* panel displays the tree of components added to the layout. Elements of the tree can be rearranged using drag-and-drop, as sometimes this is more convenient than doing the same on the canvas. You can remove, copy, cut or paste an element in the hierarchy using right click.
* The *Properties* panel displays visual component properties.
