==== Application Themes

Studio facilitates working with application {main_man_url}/gui_themes.html[themes]: you can create theme extensions or custom themes in one click.

When you create a theme extension or a custom theme, the special directory structure is created. Also, Studio modifies `build.gradle` script to build the new theme and executes Gradle `Ã¬dea` task to apply the project changes.

The created themes will be displayed in the *Themes* section of CUBA tree.

After extending or creating a theme, you can modify its variables manually as the SCSS file or in the visual editor:
