== CUBA Web Components

CUBA platform provides a set of specific web components for solving common problems that arise when working
with CUBA applications:

* <<cuba_app, cuba-app>> - initializes a CUBA application. It is required in order to use any other CUBA web component.

* <<cuba__login, cuba-login>> - a login form with material design. It allows users to log in using the
same credentials as for the standard CUBA UI.

* <<cuba__entities, cuba-entity, cuba-entities, cuba-entity-form>> - components for loading and saving entities.

* <<cuba__rest, cuba-query, cuba-service, cuba-service-form>> - components for using custom elements of CUBA REST API.

* <<cuba__file, cuba-file-field>> - a component for uploading files to the server.

In order to create an application with a custom design, our UI components (`cuba-login`, `cuba-file-field`) can be used as a template for creating your own components.

Components that work with entities (`cuba-entity`, `cuba-entities`, `cuba-entity-form`) are most convenient if an application has a relatively simple data model. For more complex cases, use custom service methods and
queries (`cuba-query`, `cuba-service`, `cuba-service-form`).
