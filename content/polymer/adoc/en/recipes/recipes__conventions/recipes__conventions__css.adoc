==== Shared CSS

Polymer elements use Shadow DOM and their styles don't overlap with each other. It's a very useful feature, but sometimes
you may want to share some CSS between elements.

Let's examine an example of how to re-use CSS.

First of all we need to create an element that contains common styles we want to share.

.src/recipes/convention/css/shared-styles.html
[source, html]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/polymer-build/src/recipes/convention/css/shared-styles.html[]
----

So, we have declared a class and a variable with a color. Now, we can use them in other components.

.src/recipes/convention/css/blue-button.html
[source, html]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/polymer-build/src/recipes/convention/css/blue-button.html[]
----

The resulting `blue-button` element looks as follows:

[subs="none"]
++++

<link rel="import" href="html/src/recipes/convention/css/blue-button.html">

<div class="polymer-demo-container">
    <blue-button></blue-button>
</div>

++++
