=== Adding a Library

Currently CUBA Polymer UI module uses https://bower.io/[Bower] as a package manager.
Therefore, you can import any library that is published on https://github.com[GitHub].

Imagine that you want to use https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/paper-toggle-button[paper-toggle-button] in your project.
Its source code is located at https://github.com/PolymerElements/paper-toggle-button.

There are two ways to add this library to your project:

. Via command line:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ bower install PolymerElements/paper-toggle-button --save
----

. Manually add it to `bower.json`:
+
[source,javascript]
----
...
"dependencies": {
  ...
  "paper-toggle-button": "PolymerElements/paper-toggle-button"
},
...
----

The library will be downloaded to `bower_components/paper-toggle-button` folder and can be used in your code.

By default, Bower uses a default branch of the required dependency.
If you want to use another version, specify it after the `#` sign:

[source,bash]
----
$ bower install PolymerElements/paper-toggle-button#3.0.0-pre.1 --save
----
