== Common Tasks

From project to project, from one framework to another, we face the same set of standard problems:

* How to implement internationalization?

* How to build a navigation block?

* How to inject services into components?

* And so on.

Polymer doesn't have a goal to solve these problems for us.
It's primary intention was to provide convenient means for creating custom reusable components.
Dependency injection, navigation, etc. are beyond this task.

In this chapter, we discuss some of the common problems encountered in front-end development
and offer solutions for them. Please consider our recommendations not as ultimate truth but as one of the possible ways to handle a problem.
